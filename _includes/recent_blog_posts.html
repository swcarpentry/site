    <p>   I was talking with friends over the holiday about the future of science   and how it might one day be funded.   Since it'll be ten years before I'm proven wrong,   it seems like a good topic with which to start the new year. </p>

    <p>   A lot of people qualified as instructors this fall and winter,   thanks in part to the live sessions we ran in Charlottesville, Norwich, and Seattle.   They join the 86 other people who received their badge this year;   we look forward to seeing them all run workshops before 2015 is over. </p>

<p>
    <p>   From 26-30 January,   an election will be held for the seven vacant positions on the   inaugural Steering Committee of the Software Carpentry Foundation.   This will be one of the biggest steps in the project's journey   from two guys staying up until 3:00 am fourteen years ago   to write lessons on Perl for scientists at Los Alamos   to a mature open project run by the volunteers it belongs to. </p> <p>   If you are a qualified instructor who has taught at least twice in the past two years,   or have done a significant chunk of non-teaching work for Software Carpentry,   you can both stand for election and vote.   We strongly urge you to consider standing:   if you're willing and able to commit to giving the Foundation 3 hours a week,   you'll help thousands of scientists get more done in less time and with less pain.   It'll be fun, too:   few things in life are as rewarding as building something,   and our members are building something extraordinary. </p> <p>   In order to stand for election,   you must write a blog post to introduce yourself to the community   by Friday, January 16   (i.e., a full week before the start of the election).   This post: </p> <ul>   <li>     <p>       must be around 500 words long,     </p>   </li>   <li>     <p>       can be written in any format (e.g. question and answer, paragraph text),       and     </p>   </li>   <li>     <p>       must be titled, "2015 Election: Your Name"     </p>   </li> </ul> <p>   You can submit your post as a pull request   to <a href="{{site.github_url}}/site">this website's repository</a>   or <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">by email</a>.   It should explain: </p> <ul>   <li>     <p>       what your background is,     </p>   </li>   <li>     <p>       what your previous involvement with Software Carpentry has been,       and most importantly     </p>   </li>   <li>     <p>       what you will do as a member of the Steering Committee       to contribute to the growth and success of Software Carpentry.     </p>   </li> </ul> <p>   The last point is the most important.   If you have experience managing money,   we need a Treasurer;   if your passion is helping new instructors or figuring out how well we're doing,   we need people to lead   <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/12/plans-for-2015-mentorship-and-assessment.html">mentorship and assessment</a>,   while if you come from a part of the world that hasn't seen much Software Carpentry activity yet,   you might want to take the lead in getting us going there. </p> <p>   (Actually,   the point that's <em>really</em> most important is that   everyone will still be very welcome to volunteer in other ways,   and that doing so will be as valuable as ever.   We will still need topic maintainers,   help with the website,   and many other things,   and I hope that having more people coordinating things   will actually make it easier for you all to lend a hand.) </p> <p>   If seven or fewer nominations are received,   those people who nominated will be automatically appointed to the Steering Committee   and no formal election will be held.   Vacancies on the Steering Committee can be filled at any time at the Committee's discretion.   The regular positions on the Steering Committee   (Chair, Vice-Chair, Secretary, Treasurer and then any others the Committee feels it needs)   will be decided by a vote at the Committee's first meeting. </p>

<p>
    <p>   As <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/10/new-lesson-template-v2.html">we said back in October</a>,   we're splitting the <a href="{{site.github_url}}/bc">existing lesson repository</a>   into smaller and more manageable pieces.   To do that,   we have defined   <a href="{{site.github_url}}/lesson-template">a new template for lessons</a>,   and have been extracting the history of the existing material from the current repository.   (We wanted to get the entire history of each lesson   so that people would receive credit for the work they've done.)   The second step has taken longer than planned,   but we now have all of the core novice lessons in repositories of their own: </p>
