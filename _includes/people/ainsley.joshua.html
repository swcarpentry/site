    is a Postdoctoral Scholar at Tufts University,
    where he applies bioinformatic and machine learning approaches to neuroscience research
    aimed at better understanding learning and memory.
    As someone who had to slowly gain programming skills to understand the large biological data sets generated by his research,
    he is excited to make the process a bit easier for others.
