  <h2>New Exercises, Lessons, and Examples</h2>

  <p>
    We welcome new exercises and lessons
    (particularly lessons that show how the things we teach fit together
    by working through medium-sized problems).
    A good exercise has a single clear focus,
    and should be doable in five minutes or less;
    for examples,
    take a look at the "Challenges" sections of
    <a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/bc/lessons/swc-shell/tutorial.html">our introduction to the Unix shell</a>.
    We'd particularly like Python exercises that use
    <a href="#related">ipythonblocks and skimage.novice</a> in the IPython Notebook,
    exercises for our <a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/bc/lessons/swc-web/tutorial.html">web programming lesson</a>,
    and ones for using Git and GitHub.
  </p>

  <p>
    For an example of what we'd like in a longer lesson,
    please look at the <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/invperc/">invasion percolation example</a>,
    which covers topics as diverse as restructuring code to make it more testable,
    performance profiling,
    and the advantages of lazy data structures.
    Such examples can be specific to different research disciplines,
    which often makes them the most convincing part of our bootcamp.
    If you're looking for starting points,
    we'd like to rewrite our examples of
    <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/setdict/phylogen.html">constructing phylogenetic trees</a>,
    <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/media/steg.html">counting stars</a>,
    and
    <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/media/stars.html">steganography</a>.
    We'd like to add
    a simple N-body simulation that included discussion of testing in the face of floating-point roundoff,
    calculating and visualizing spatial correlations between different data sets,
    something like Prof. Lorena Barba's
    <a href="http://lorenabarba.com/blog/cfd-python-12-steps-to-navier-stokes/">12 Steps to Navier Stokes</a>
    (but shorter, since we only have a couple of hours),
    and some more gene sequence wrangling.
    If you'd like to tackle one of these,
    or have ideas of your own,
    please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">email us</a>:
    we'd be happy to chat.

  <h2>Related Projects</h2>

  <p>
    We teach using many people's tools,
    and contributions to those will always help us.
    In particular:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="http://github.com/jiffyclub/ipythonblocks">ipythonblocks</a>
      and
      <a href="http://github.com/synesthesiam/novice">skimage.novice</a>
      have let us adopt a media-first approach to teaching programming.
      Enhancements to either of these are very welcome.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="http://github.com/wolever/browsercast">BrowserCast</a> will,
      when finished,
      allow us to replay an IPython Notebook in sync with a voiceover&mdash;in other words,
      to use the Notebook for screencasting
      <em>without</em> the large file sizes
      and loss of first-class content
      that plague current screencasting options.
    </li>
    <li>
      There are lots of plugins for the <a href="http://ipython.org">IPython Notebook</a>
      that would make our job easier.
      We'd particularly like something like <a href="http://regexpal.com">Regex Pal</a>
      for teaching regular expressions
      and an embedded vector drawing widget for doing diagrams.
      If you're interested in working with a great bunch of developers
      on a tool that's changing the way scientists work every day,
      please <a href="mailto::{{site.contact}}">get in touch.
