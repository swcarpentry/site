  <dt id="what-is-swc">What is Software Carpentry?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Software Carpentry is a volunteer organization whose goal is
      to make scientists more productive,
      and their work more reliable,
      by teaching them basic computing skills.
      Founded in 1998,
      it runs short, intensive workshops that cover
      program design, version control, testing, and task automation.
      The <a href="{{page.root}}/scf/index.html">Software Carpentry Foundation</a>
      was created in October 2014 to act as a governing body for the project.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="why-does-swc-exist">Why does Software Carpentry exist?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Because computing is now an integral part of every aspect of science,
      but most scientists are never taught how to build, use, validate, and share software well.
      As a result,
      many spend hours or days doing things badly
      that could be done well in just a few minutes.
      Our goal is to change that
      so that scientists can spend less time wrestling with software
      and more time doing useful research.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="team">Who created all this?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/team.html">Many people</a>
      have helped Software Carpentry grow
      by creating lessons,
      teaching workshops,
      and building its web site&mdash;you can find
      a fuller description in <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2013/06/lessons-learned.html">this blog post</a>.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="sponsors">Who pays for all this?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The costs associated with particular workshops are covered by their hosts:
      our instructors are volunteers,
      so these costs usually amount to travel and accommodation.
      Central costs,
      such as instructor training and curriculum development,
      are paid for by
      <a href="{{page.root}}/scf/workshops.html">an administration fee</a>
      for each workshop we help arrange,
      by <a href="{{page.root}}/scf/membership.html">membership dues</a> from
      our <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/sponsors.html">partners and affiliates</a>,

      <li>
        automating tasks using the Unix shell;
      </li>
      <li>

<h2 id="instructors">Instructor Training</h2>

<dl>

  <dt id="who-are-your-instructors">Who are the instructors?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Our instructors are scientists themselves&mdash;in fact,
      many are workshop alumni.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="why-become-an-instructor">Why do people become instructors?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      For many reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <em>To make their own lives better.</em>
        By teaching their fellow scientists how to build and share better software,
        our instructors are indirectly helping to create things that they themselves can use.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Because it's fun.</em>
        How could it not be?
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>To build a reputation.</em>
        Teaching a workshop is a great way for people to introduce themselves to places they'd eventually like to work,
        and a great way to make contact with potential collaborators.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Get practice teaching.</em>
        We're doing more every year to train instructors,
        and giving them chances to teach online as well&mdash;both of which are useful for people with academic careers in mind.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Help get people of diverse backgrounds into the pipeline.</em>
        Computer Science is 12-15% female,
        and that figure has been <em>dropping</em> since the 1980s.
        Some of our instructors are involved in part because they want computational science to include a broader range of people.
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>Teaching forces you to learn new things, or learn old things in more detail than you already know.</em>
        See for example "<a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/content/333/6045/1037.abstract">Graduate Students' Teaching Experiences Improve Their Methodological Research Skills</a>".
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>The more you know, the less you have to write yourself.</em>
        Putting a grant application together? Have a site review coming up?  We probably have slides for that... :-)
      </li>
      <li>
        <em>To make the world a better place.</em>
        The two things we need to get through the next hundred years are more science and more courage.
        Software Carpentry can't do much about the latter,
        but we can help with the former.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </dd>

  <dt id="how-become-instructor">How can I become an instructor myself?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      We offer a <a href="{{site.training_url}}">free online training course</a>
      for people who would like to teach Software Carpentry,
      and to learn more about teaching in general along the way.
      The course takes 2-4 hours a week for 12-14 weeks (depending on interruptions);
      most work is done on trainees' own time,
      and is posted to the <a href="http://teaching.software-carpentry.org">course blog</a>.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="who-can-take-instructor-training">Who can take part in the instructor training course?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      While we would like to help everyone learn how to teach programming,
      space in the course is limited.
      We therefore give preference to people who have taken part in a workshop themselves,
      are planning to host a workshop,
      or have relevant prior experience.

  <dt id="becoming-a-core-contributor">How do I become a core contributor?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      A core contributor is someone who can commit changes directly to our shared repositories.
      The process for becoming one
      is taken directly from <a href="http://docs.python.org/devguide/coredev.html">the Python project</a>:
      when you have consistently contributed patches which meet quality standards without requiring extensive rewrites prior to being committed,
      you may qualify for commit privileges and become a core contributor of Software Carpentry.
      You must also work well with other core contributor (and people in general)
      as you become an ambassador for the project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Typically a core contirbutor will offer you the chance to gain commit privileges.
      The person making the offer will become your mentor and watch your commits for a while to make sure you understand the development process.
      If other core contributor agree that you should gain commit privileges you are then extended an official offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may request commit privileges yourself,
      but do not be surprised if your request is turned down.
      Do not take this personally!
      It simply means that other core contributors think you need more time contributing patches before you are able to commit them without supervision.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="how-contribute">How else can I contribute?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      If you don't want to teach,
      there are many other ways you can help,
      such as writing new lessons,
      answering learners' questions online,
      and maintaining this web site:
      please see <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/projects.html">this page</a> for details.
      We are also always looking for more sponsors:
      please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">mail us</a> if you'd like to help with that.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="how-acknowledge">How can I acknowledge Software Carpentry's help in my own work?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      We appreciate being mentioned in the acknowledgments sections of papers, theses, and proposals,
      as it helps us show current and potential funders what impact we're having.
      If you would like to do this,
      please use something like the following:

  </dd>

  <dt id="other-initiatives">What other initiatives is Software Carpentry connected to?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Software Carpentry has a close relationship with
      the <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">Software Sustainability Institute</a>,
      which manages workshops in the United Kingdom.
      We have worked with them since June 2012 to develop
      a "driver's license" for the
      <a href="http://zuserver2.star.ucl.ac.uk/dirac/home.html">DiRAC supercomputing consortium</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are working with the <a href="http://ipython.org">IPython</a> team
      to develop an IPython Notebook plugin that will
      synchronize a voice-over soundtrack with a step-by-step display of a notebook,
      thereby creating a screencast-style presentation in the browser.

  <dt id="what-is-workshop">What is a workshop?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      A workshop is a hands-on combination of instruction and programming,
      typically two days long,
      that covers the <a href="#core-topics">core skills needed to be productive in a small research team</a>.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="how-much-will-i-learn">Will I really learn all this in just two days?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Not all of it&mdash;not even most of it&mdash;but
      enough to do your work more efficiently,
      and to start taking advantage of online resources
      like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>
      that assume a certain level of background knowledge.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="workshop-curriculum">Is the workshop curriculum set in stone?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Our audience is as diverse as science itself,
      so we do our best to tailor our teaching to each group's needs.
      However,
      any workshop that wants to
      <a href="#trademark">use our name and logo</a>
      must cover <a href="#core-topics">a few core topics</a>.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="why-not-teach-x">Why don't you teach X?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Data visualization,
      high-performance computing (HPC),
      Perl:
      the list of things we don't teach is much longer than the list of things we do.
      As with every curriculum,
      the question is not, "What would we like to add?"
      but, "What are we willing to take out in order to make room?"
      We believe our <a href="#core-topics">core topics</a>
      are the absolute minimum scientists need to know
      in order to do computing well.
      We also believe that topics like HPC are covered well enough by other groups.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="workshop-costs">Are workshops free?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Some workshops charge $20-$40 for registration,
      primarily because it reduces the number of people who register but not attend
      from 20-25% to roughly 5%.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="workshop-prerequisites">Are any pre-requisite skills necessary to attend a workshop?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      The only truly necessary skill is a desire to become more efficient.
      Each workshop is unique,
      and people with different skill levels will bring home different lessons,
      but everyone will learn something useful.
      That said,
      when we have enough space and instructors,
      we do try to stream people according to prior knowledge
      so that we can tailor training for them.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="bring-what-to-workshop">Do I need to bring anything to the workshop?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      In most cases, yes:
      workshops are meant to be hands-on,
      which means your hands should be on a keyboard while you're learning.
      While some sites have training machines,
      we encourage people to bring their own laptops
      so that they leave the workshop with a working set of tools installed and operational.
    </p>
    <p>
      We also ask people to install the software their workshop requires <em>before</em> showing up,
      so that we don't have three dozen people trying to download installers
      through the same wireless network at once.
      Each workshop's instructors will circulate a list of required software
      (and installation instructions)
      well in advance of the start.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="why-workshop">Why two-day workshops?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Between 1998 and 2012,
      we taught this material in intensive week-long courses,
      as a regular university course,
      and online,
      with varying degrees of frustration.
      It turns out that researchers are busy people:
      improving their computing skills will make them more productive in the long run,
      but in the short run,
      they have to get a grant proposal in by Thursday,
      mark mid-terms by Monday,
      and meet a paper deadline next week.
      While two days may not sound like much,
      it's all many researchers can fit in.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="workshop-audience">Who are workshops for?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Our learners are typically graduate students
      in science, engineering, medicine, and related research-intensive disciplines
      who have written a few lines of code
      (either on their own or for an "Intro to Computing" class as undergrads)
      but aren't familiar with computing's equivalent of good laboratory practices.
      <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/audience.html">These short bios</a>
      are representative of their needs
      and how we can help.
    </p>
  </dd>

  <dt id="effectiveness">Do workshops really work?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Yes:
      two independent studies in 2012 found that people really were learning useful things,
      and <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/testimonials.html">these testimonials</a> from past participants
      show just how much difference a couple of days of training can make.
      We are now using standardized pre- and post-assessment questionnaires and interviews
      to gain more insight.

  </dd>

  <dt id="why-else-attend">Why else should I attend a workshop?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Along with their immediate benefits,
      workshops are a great opportunity to network with like-minded researchers.
      These skills are also useful for people transitioning out of research
      into other careers in science, technology, engineering, and medicine.

  <dt id="workshop-format">What does a typical workshop look like?</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>
      Workshops usually run for two consecutive days,
      starting at 8:30 and running to 4:30 or 5:00 each day
      with breaks for coffee and lunch.
      A typical boot has 40 learners,
      2 instructors,
      and 2-3 helpers wandering the room answering questions during practical sessions.
      (These helpers are often alumni of previous workshops
      who are hoping to become instructors themselves.)

      Short tutorials alternate with hands-on practical exercises,
      and participants are encouraged both to help one another,
      and to apply what they are learning to their own research problems
      during, between, and after sessions.

    <p>
      Absolutely.
      We have found in the past that if people attend in groups
      (e.g., if a whole lab's worth of students show up together),
      then everyone gets more out of the training.
      People who sign up together are more likely to have similar interests and backgrounds,
      and are usually less inhibited about asking questions,
      and asking one another for help,
      than total strangers.
      Plus,
      it's a great opportunity to wear that departmental t-shirt that's sitting in your drawer...

      If you'd like us to teach a workshop for you,
      the first step is to <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">get in touch</a>.
      We'll find instructors in your geographic and/or academic area,
      and do advertising, registration, and software setup,
      while you'll take care of travel costs and administrative overheads,
      booking space,
      local publicity,
      finding helpers,
      and catering (if desired).
      If you want to know more about what is involved in running a workshop,

      While anyone can use our material,
      the name "Software Carpentry" and our logo are both trademarked,
      and may only be used if
      <a href="#trademark">certain conditions</a> are met.
      We're all in favor of teaching people iPhone game programming,
      multigrid methods using C++ and MPI,
      and scientific grant writing,
      but we've worked hard to establish an identity for Software Carpentry,
      and wish to protect it.

      Yes,
      but you may not call your course "Software Carpentry"
      or use our logo
      without <a href="#trademark">first obtaining permission</a>.
