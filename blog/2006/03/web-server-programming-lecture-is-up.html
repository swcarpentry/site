title: Web Server Programming Lecture Is Up
category: [lectures, versions/version-3]
---
<p>The lecture on server-side programming is up: if you think it should be split into two parts, please let me know.  That leaves only three to go (XML, security, and integration).</p>
<p>And by this time on Thursday, we'll be in Lima, Peru...</p>
