title: Integration and XML Lectures
category: ["Content"]

<p>Hot on the heels of yesterday's lecture on integration (which desperately needs iron-willed editing) comes a rewrite of the XML lecture.  This is a mix of HTML formatting rules and tags, and DOM; I'd appreciate knowing if you think it hangs together, and whether there needs to be more on how to process XML programmatically.</p>
