### Overview

Individual lessons are currently in folders in the [bootcamp]
repository, e.g. `novice/python`. The aim of history extraction is
to take the content and history of an individual lesson and move it
to a new repository specifically for that lesson.

The reason for preserving the history of lessons is that we want to
recognise past contributions - just copying and pasting the files
would remove this.


### Guide procedure for an individual lesson

We'll use the novice python lesson as an example throughout.

1. One person takes ownership of the history extraction for a
   specific lesson and creates an issue on [bc][bootcamp] with the
   labels `Extract History`, `novice`, `Python` and a title, e.g.
   'Extract history of novice Python lesson'.

   Progress regarding the history extraction is then tracked in that
   issue, ([example][novice-python-issue]).

   An overview of all of the current extractions can be seen using
   the [Extract History] label.

2. That person creates a personal repository, e.g.
   [aaren/swc-novice-python][swc-novice-python] where the history
   extraction takes place.

   The exact process used for extracting the history varies a little
   by lesson. Inspiration can be found in the issues on [bc][Extract History],
   for example the [novice python issue][novice-python-issue] or the
   [shell extraction](https://github.com/wking/swc-modular-shell/issues/3).

3. At this point the `novice/python` lesson in [bc][bootcamp] is
   frozen. All new issues and Pull Requests should be made against
   the new repository (linked in the issue).

4. When the history extraction is completed, the new issues and
   pull-requests can be reviewed. When all are dealt with, the
   lesson is frozen again and transitioned to fit the new
   [lesson-template] in a [swcarpentry] repository.

5. Following the transition to the lesson template, the lesson is
   LIVE! and is in a permanent new home.
