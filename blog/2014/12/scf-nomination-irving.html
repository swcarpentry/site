  Over the last five years, I've had the full spectrum of Software Carpentry experiences. 
  I started out as a novice learner, moved on to organize and help at a workshop, 
  and I'm now a regular instructor, lesson developer, blog contributor, 
  interim Steering Committee member, 
  and unofficial lead of Software Carpentry activities in Australia. 
  Along the way, 
  I've demonstrated a knack for community building and a passion and 
  talent for teaching computational best practices to scientists. 
  To give you a sense of who I am and what I'm about, 
  I should probably start from the beginning...

  In late 2009, 
  I completed a Bachelor of Science (Meteorology) at the University of Melbourne. 
  During the final honours year of that degree, 
  I had my first real taste of programming (in Fortran) and working at the command line. 
  It was a fairly steep learning curve, 
  but by the end of that year I was feeling fairly confident about my skills. 
  So much so, in fact, that I managed to score a job at CSIRO 
  (a national research institute in Australia). 
  As you can imagine, it took about five seconds in my new role for the illusions 
  regarding my programming skills to be shattered. 
  Floundering in terabytes of climate model data and the vagaries of Python programming, 
  the next two years were a blur of ad hoc, self-directed learning experiences, 
  as I tried to improve my skills whilst also meeting project deadlines.

  I first stumbled upon the Software Carpentry website in 2012. 
  Given the experiences of the previous two years, 
  its mission and lesson materials really spoke to me. 
  In my excitement, 
  I sent an email to Greg Wilson who (much to my surprise) agreed to come out to Australia
  in early 2013 to teach the first ever workshops outside of Europe and North America. 
  Around this time I also started a blog on research best practices in the weather and 
  climate sciences (<a href="https://drclimate.wordpress.com/">Dr Climate</a>) and 
  moved back to the University of Melbourne to start a PhD.
</p>
<p>
  A new project called the <a href="http://resbaz.tumblr.com/">Research Bazaar</a> 
  sprung up at the university in late 2013, 
  with the mission of teaching researchers digital research skills. 
  At the time I was the only qualified Software Carpentry instructor in town, 
  so the project coordinator offered to pay me to run regular workshops and 
  to foster a community of instructors and helpers in Melbourne 
  (and Australia more broadly). 
  You can read more about our experiences 
  <a href="http://www.software-carpentry.org/blog/2014/11/institutional-partnerships.html">here</a> 
  or listen to me speak on the topic at PyCon Australia 
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQ12NmsLfsg&amp;index=38&amp;list=PLs4CJRBY5F1Jm7H1dlesRvEgr-28QGXpR">here</a>, 
  but suffice to say Melbourne is now a very strong hub of Software Carpentry activity. 
  The Research Bazaar ran eight workshops in 2014 and has many more planned for 2015.

  When Greg asked me to be part of the interim Steering Committee, 
  I was more than happy to help out. 
  Not only did I feel that my previous experiences allowed me to identify and relate to 
  people at all levels of the organisation 
  (from novice learners through to experienced instructors and lesson developers), 
  but I also have a great deal of experience on Boards and Committees. 
  I've been the National Secretary of the Australian Meteorological and Oceanographic 
  Society for the past four years and until recently also served on the Board of a 
  not-for-profit called Creative Spark. 
  If elected to the 2015 Steering Committee, 
  I'd love the chance to continue the work that the interim Committee has set in motion, 
  consolidating Software Carpentry as a financially self-sustaining and 
  democratic organisation for the future.
