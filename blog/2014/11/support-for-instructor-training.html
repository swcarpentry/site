<p>
  We have two pieces of good news about instructor training,
  and a plea for support.
  The first piece of good news is how many of the participants
  from the courses we've run online and in person this summer and fall
  are completing and getting certified&mdash;we look set to break 50% for the first time.
  The other piece of good news is that
  we have 136 people signed up for the online course starting in January.
  If half or more of them become active instructors,
  we won't just have a larger pool:
  we'll also have broader coverage both geographically and of different research discplines.
</p>
<p>
  But running a class for that many people will take at least two days a week,
  and since Sloan and Mozilla are no longer funding me,
  I need to find sponsors to underwrite my time
  in order to run the course.
  (We could charge participants to raise the money,
  but I'm very reluctant to do that:
  we're already asking people to give us their time
  during the training and afterward,
  and I don't think someone should have to pay to do good.)
</p>
<p>
  I am therefore kicking off Software Carpentry's first targeted fundraising drive.
  If you or your organization would like to make online instructor training in January possible,
  please click on the button below
  or <a href="mailto:gvwilson@software-carpentry.org">mail me directly</a>
  to discuss ways and means.
  We now have a
  <a href="scf-creation-faq.html">fiscal sponsorship agreement</a>
  with <a href="http://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>,
  so we can issue invoices and tax receipts as necessary.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks in advance for your support.
