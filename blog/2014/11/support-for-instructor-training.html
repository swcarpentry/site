<p>
  The first piece of good news about instructor training is
  how many of the participants from the live and online courses this summer and fall
  are completing and getting certified&mdash;we look set to break 50% for the first time.
  The second is that we have 136 people signed up for the online course starting in January.
  Even if only half of them complete,
  it will enlarge the pool of instructors by more than a third,
  and give us broader coverage both geographically and of different research discplines.
</p>
<p>
  This class will be twice the size of any I've run before,
  and teaching a group that size will take at least two days a week.
  Since I am no longer with the Mozilla Science Lab,
  we need to find sponsors to underwrite my time.
  (We could charge participants a fee,
  but I'm very reluctant to do that:
  we're already asking people to give us their time
  during the training and afterward,
  and I don't think someone should have to pay to do good.)
</p>
<p>
  We are therefore asking the Software Carpentry community
  to help us raise the money needed to make this happen,
  and to consider supporting Software Carpentry in general.
  If you or your organization would like to help,
  please click on the button below
  or <a href="mailto:{{site.director}}">mail us directly</a>
  to discuss ways and means.
  And if you know an organization that would like to help us
  help scientists, engineers, librarians, and medical researchers
  get more done with computers in less time and with less pain,
  please put them in touch:
  we now have a
  <a href="scf-creation-faq.html">fiscal sponsorship agreement</a>
  with <a href="http://numfocus.org/">NumFOCUS</a>,
  so we can issue invoices and tax receipts as necessary.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks in advance for your support.
