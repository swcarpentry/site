<p>
  I'm still digesting
  <a href="./improving-instructor-training.html">our first live instructor training events</a>,
  and the way I saw Andromeda Yelton teaching at
  <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2014/01/bootcamp-for-librarians.html">our first bootcamp for librarians</a>
  back in January.
  I have also been reading the
  <a href="http://cwsei.ubc.ca/resources/files/CourseTransformationGuide_CWSEI_CU-SEI.pdf">Course Transformation Guide</a>
  put together by the science education initiatives at UBC and the University of Colorado,
  and would like to try an experiment.
  Instead of our usual mix of lectures and practicals,
  I would like to have a room full of learners work through our <a href="{{page.root}}/v5/index.html">lessons</a>
  at their own speed
  while helpers float the room answering questions.
  We'd have to improve the challenges in our lessons
  (and provide solutions),
  and probably create introductory webcasts to orient people new to the subjects,
  but those both seem like good targets for our
  <a href="./multisite-sprint-in-july.html">multi-site sprint in July</a>.
  If you're interested in lending a hand,
  please <a href="{{site.contact}}">get in touch</a>.
