<p>
  We are pleased to announce that registration is now open for our largest event ever:
  on April 14-15, 2014,
  we will run three workshops in parallel
  in association with <a href="FIXME">PyCon 2014</a> in Montreal,
  as well as a master class in next-generation sequencing
  and an introduction to R for Python programmers.
</p>

<p>
  The regular workshop is our largest ever, so we're splitting it into
  three rooms for learners at different levels.  We'll assign you to
  the most suitable level (based on a survey we'll send out before the
  bootcamp) so you can be sure the material won't go over your head
  (or under your feet).  It will take place at the
  spectacular <a href="http://congresmtl.com/en/montreal/near-the-palais/">Palais
  des Congr&egrave;s</a> in Montreal's International District, close
  to the Montreal business district, Chinatown, Old Montreal, and is
  connected to the Montreal Metro's Place-d'Armes station.
  Please use <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/pycon-montreal-software-carpentry-bootcamp-registration-10151376039">this link</a>
  to register.
</p>
<p>
  We're also running two special one-day classes at the same time.
  Monday's will be taught by Prof. Titus Brown, who will explore
  <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/pycon-montreal-ngs-master-class-by-software-carpentry-registration-10151618765">next-generation
  sequencing</a> (NGS) and other topics in bioinformatics using
  Python.  Tuesday's, which will be taught by Prof. Ramnath
  Vaidyanathan, will be an
  <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/e/pycon-montreal-r-for-pythonistas-master-class-by-software-carpentry-registration-10319320365">introduction
  to R</a> for Python programmers.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the tools and techniques you'll learn in these
  workshops, this is an opportunity to meet more than 150 other
  scientists who are using the same tools and facing the same
  challenges as you.  We encourage you to sign up in pairs or groups
  so that you have friends to work with at the bootcamp, and can
  support one another when you're back at your desk applying what
  you've learned.
