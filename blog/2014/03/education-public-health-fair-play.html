  There was an interesting discussion on Twitter yesterday about
  whether we should teach beginners programming using the IPython Notebook,
  the command line,
  or something else.
  Robert Davey <a href="http://froggleston.wordpress.com/2014/03/19/bioinformatics-basics-training-conundrum/">posted</a>
  a good summary of the issues raised,
  and Nick Loman wrote <a href="http://biomickwatson.wordpress.com/2014/03/20/is-this-a-realistic-portrait-of-a-modern-studentpost-doc-in-biology/">this</a> to elicit descriptions of what a "typical" biologist looks like,
  but what I'd like to focus on is
  <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/445950709448847360">one of Nick's tweets</a>:

  In educational theory there are only opinions, never data ;)

  Respectfully,
  I disagree.
  Have a look at
  <a href="https://www.psych.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/mayer">Richard Mayer</a>'s work
  on cognitive models of multimedia learning,
  <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/dept/psychology/cgi-bin/drupalm/cdweck">Carol Dweck</a>'s
  on the effect that learners' self-conceptions have on their learnings,
  or,
  closer to home,
  Porter et al's paper
  "Halving Fail Rates using Peer Instruction: A Study of Four Computer Science Courses"
  (which is unfortunately paywalled,
  because why would the ACM want you to <em>read</em> research?).
  If those aren't enough to convince you,
  grab a copy of
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Principles/dp/0470484101/"><em>How Learning Works</em></a>,
  which is a great summary of what we know and how to act on it.
  And yes,
  many findings in education research are tentative, incomplete, or contradictory,
  and it is often caught up in larger social or political agendas,
  but the same is true of a field like public health,
  and I think we'd all agree that it's a "real" science.
</p>
<p>
  My request for scientists to take education and education research seriously
  is motivated by more than just professional courtesy.
  As scientists,
  we want people to pay attention to what we know about
  climate change, drug-resistant diseases, and the other challenges
  because it's the only way we'll get through the next hundred years
  without disaster on an almost unimaginable scale.
  Taking other people's evidence seriously won't accomplish that on its own,
  but I think it's a necessary first step.
