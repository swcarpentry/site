  There was an interesting discussion on Twitter yesterday about
  whether we should teach beginners programming using the IPython Notebook,
  the command line,
  or something else.
  Robert Davey <a href="http://froggleston.wordpress.com/2014/03/19/bioinformatics-basics-training-conundrum/">posted</a>
  a good summary of the issues raised,
  but what I'd like to focus on is
  <a href="https://twitter.com/pathogenomenick/status/445950709448847360">this tweet</a>

  In educational theory there are only opinions, never data ;)

  If you don't believe me,
  have a look at
  <a href="https://www.psych.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/mayer">Richard Mayer</a>'s work
  on cognitive models of multimedia learning,
  <a href="https://www.stanford.edu/dept/psychology/cgi-bin/drupalm/cdweck">Carol Dweck</a>'s
  on the effect that learners' self-conceptions have on their learnings,
  or,
  closer to home,
  Porter et al's paper
  "Halving Fail Rates using Peer Instruction: A Study of Four Computer Science Courses".
  If that's not enough to convince you,
  grab a copy of
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/How-Learning-Works-Research-Based-Principles/dp/0470484101/"><em>How Learning Works</em></a>,
  which is a well-written guide to both what we know and how to act on it.

  I've never met Dr. Loman,
  but I'm willing to bet that he's not a fan of the way
  homeopathists and anti-vaccine nuts casually brush aside
  decades of painstaking research by scientists like himself.
  I would therefore ask him not to do that to educational researchers.
  Yes,
  many of their findings are tentative, incomplete, or contradictory,
  and yes,
  education research is often caught up in larger social or political agendas,
  but the same is true of a field like public health,
  and I think he'd agree that it's a "real" science.
</p>
<p>
  My request is motivated by more than professional courtesy.
  I want people to base their opinions and decisions on solid scientific evidence
  because I think it's the only way we'll get through the next hundred years
  without disaster on an almost unimaginable scale.
  I therefore try to base my teaching and programming on research in education and software engineering
  because I think the only way to lead is by example.
  If we want people to pay attention to what we know about climate change,
  drug-resistant diseases,
  and the other challenges we face,
  we have to pay attention to what we know about how brains learn.
