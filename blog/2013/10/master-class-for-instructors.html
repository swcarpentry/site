<p>
  Thanks to generous support from <a href="http://ged.msu.edu/">Prof. Titus Brown</a>,
  we are pleased to announce that
  we will offer a week-long residential master class on teaching programming
  on August 11-15, 2014.
  The class will take place at the <a href="http://www.kbs.msu.edu/">Kellogg Biological Station</a>,
  a beautiful rural site about an hour from Lansing, Michigan,
  and will cover what we actually know about how to teach programming
  and why we believe it.
  The instructors will be world-renowned experts with extensive hands-on experience,
  and enrolment will be restricted to 40 participants to ensure lively, hands-on learning.
  The cost, curriculum, and application procedure will be announced early in the new year,
  but if you're interested,
  please pencil it into your calendar now.
