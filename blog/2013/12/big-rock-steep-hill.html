<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>
  If you spend all your time talking to the people who make Software Carpentry happen,
  it's easy to lose sight of the fact that
  people who actually get open science and computational competence
  are still very much a minority.
  Consider,
  if you will,
  my last day at work before the holidays:
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      I spoke just before lunch
      with a provider of cloud computing services
      who offered us machine time for use in our classes.
      I told him that what we really needed was travel support
      so that we could run more classes in more places.
      He wasn't interested.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      On the same day,
      our application for funding to run a follow-on to
      our <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2013/11/code-review-report.html">code</a>
      <a href="http://mozillascience.org/code-review-for-science-what-we-learned/">review</a>
      <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2412">project</a>
      was rejected.
      The reviewers
      "...were just skeptical about the whole idea of code review becoming a widespread practice,
      even if it's a great idea,
      and for better or for worse,
      they tend to lose interest in projects if they can't envision a clear path for it to have a huge impact."
    </p>

      To complete the day,
      I got email from the people who handle publishing for the ACM.
      Turns out I couldn't use their standard LaTeX framework to submit an abstract for
      <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2013/11/sigcse-workshop.html">our SIGCSE workshop on teaching with the IPython Notebook</a>.
      Instead,
      I had to download a Microsoft WORD template (their capitalization),
      fill it in without changing any of the styling
      (good luck doing <em>that</em> on a Mac),
      output a PDF,
      upload that,
      and then enter some of the same information separately on their web site.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Most of the people involved in Software Carpentry
  (and in open science more generally)
  would understand that these three events are all symptoms of
  what a friend of mine would call an "unskilled" view of the world:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      Scientists who can program
      are clearly more likely to become customers for cloud computing
      than ones who can't.
      Rather than fighting with each other to get a bigger slice of a fairly small pie,
      cloud services companies could all do better by working to bake a bigger pie.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Skepticism about code review might have been justifiable 15 years ago,
      but the practice has become ubiquitous in open source development since then,
      fueled in large part by the adoption of code forges like <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>.
      It's actually hard to believe that scientists <em>won't</em> start doing pre-commit reviews
      as they start using code forges to host their work,
      but the longer we wait before studying it,
      the longer it will be before we know how best to adapt it to scientists' particular needs.
    </p>

      Yesterday,
      I got mail from the SIGCSE organizers saying,
      "After publishing the workshop abstracts for the SIGCSE 2014 conference,
      we've come across at least one case where
      the abstract pulled from OpenConf did not include revisions submitted by the author.
      With apologies for this rather poorly timed request given that I'm sure you are eager to bring this semester to a close,
      please check your abstract on OpenConf as soon as possible and make any necessary adjustments."
      I'm seriously tempted to offer to run a Software Carpentry workshop at the next SIGCSE
      to introduce computer scientists to version control...
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  Events like these are why I mostly don't go to open science meetups:
  the people who show up already believe what I'd preach,
  and more importantly,
  the more time I spend hanging out with them,
  the easier it will be to forget just how much work we still have to do.
  We've made tremendous progress this year&mdash;so much that
  my biggest concerns for 2014 are about managing growth&mdash;but
  we still have a very big rock to roll up a very steep hill.
