  It's been a good year for Software Carpentry,
  but one day made it clear
  how much work we still have to do:

      I spoke just before lunch
      with a provider of cloud computing services
      who offered us machine time for use in our classes.
      I told him that what we really needed was travel support for our instructors
      so that we could run more of those classes.
      He wasn't interested,
      even though scientists who know how to program
      are clearly more likely to become customers for his company
      than ones who don't.

      On the same day,
      our application for funding to run a follow-on to
      our <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2013/11/code-review-report.html">code</a>
      <a href="http://mozillascience.org/code-review-for-science-what-we-learned/">review</a>
      <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2412">project</a>
      was rejected.
      The reviewers
      "...were just skeptical about the whole idea of code review becoming a widespread practice,
      even if it's a great idea,
      and for better or for worse,
      they tend to lose interest in projects if they can't envision a clear path for it to have a huge impact."
      That skepticism might have been well-founded 15 years ago,
      but code review has become widespread in open source development since then,
      and studies over more than 30 years have shown that it's the most time-effective way known
      to find and remove bugs in software.
      There are good reasons to believe that scientists will adopt it
      as they start using code forges like <a href="http://github.com">GitHub</a> for their work,
      but the longer we wait before studying it,
      the longer it will be before we know how best to adapt it to scientists' needs.
