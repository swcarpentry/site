<p>Despite inclement weather, last week's bootcamp at the University of Virginia went well.
According to Steve Crouch,
33 researchers spent two days learning some useful computing skills from <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/team.html#crouch.s">Steve</a>,
<a href="{{page.root}}/pages/team.html#anderson.c">Carlos Anderson</a>,
and Ben Morris.
Many thanks to Stephen Turner for hosting it&mdash;we hope to be back soon.</p>
