<p>A draft schedule for the July 13-31 offering of the course is now available.  We'd welcome your feedback: does this order make sense, are there topics we've included that you don't care about, have we left out anything really important (and if so, what should we drop to make room for it), etc.</p>
<p><em>Note: the draft schedule has been retired.  Please see the <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/">course outline</a> instead.</em></p>
