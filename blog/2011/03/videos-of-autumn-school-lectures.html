<p>I'm pleased to announce that video recordings of the Software Carpentry lectures I gave in London last fall are now online at <a href="http://soundsoftware.ac.uk/autumnschool2010video">http://soundsoftware.ac.uk/autumnschool2010video</a>. Please excuse the mustache&mdash;I don't know <em>what</em> I was thinking... Many thanks to Chris Cannam, Ivan Damnjanovic, Luis Figueira, and of course Mark Plumbley.</p>
