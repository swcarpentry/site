<p>Three more episodes on MATLAB are now available, two on <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/matlab/iobasic.html">input</a> and <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/matlab/iomore.html">output</a>, and one on <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/matlab/plots.html">plotting</a>. Thanks to <a href="http://www.cs.utoronto.ca/~guy/">Tommy Guy</a> for putting them together; as always, feedback is appreciated.</p>
