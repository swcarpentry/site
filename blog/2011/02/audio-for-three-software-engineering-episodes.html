title: Audio for Three Software Engineering Episodes
category: ["Content"]
---
<p>We've added audio (and a few images) for three of the episodes on software engineering (the <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/softeng/intro.html">introduction</a>, <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/softeng/agile.html">agile development</a>, and the <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/softeng/principles.html">principles of computational thinking</a>). It's a slightly different format than most of our previous episodes, and we need to choose a better way of embedding MP3 audio in web pages, but we hope it's useful as is.</p>
