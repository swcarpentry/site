  I just finished reading Sendhil Mullainathan's book
  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Scarcity-Science-Having-Defines-Lives/dp/125005611X/">Scarcity</a>,
  which is summarized well in <a href="http://boingboing.net/2015/05/26/poverty-is-a-tax-on-cognition.html">this post</a>
  by Cory Doctorow titled
  "Poverty is a Tax on Cognition":
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    Mullainathan begins by establishing the idea that your cognition is limited&mdash;you can only think
    about a limited number of things at one time,
    and when the number of things you have to pay attention to goes beyond a certain threshold,
    you start making errors.
    Then he explains how poor people have a lot more things they have to pay attention to.
    In the UK,
    we make fun of politicians for being so out of touch that they don't know the price of a pint of milk&mdash;but poor people
    have to keep track of the price of <em>everything</em> they require.
    There's no room for error.
    Spend too much on the milk and you can't afford the bread.
  </p>
  <p>
    That's just one of the many taxes on the cognitive load of poor people.
    David Graeber's <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Utopia-Rules-David-Graeber/dp/1612195180/">Utopia of Rules</a></em> details another:
    figuring out what rich people are thinking.
    Poor people who piss off rich people face reprisals far beyond those
    that rich people can expect from each other or from poor people.
  </p>
  <p>
    This isn't unique to cash-poverty.
    Mullainathan asks his audience to recall what life is like when they're "time poor"&mdash;on a deadline
    or otherwise overburdened.
    This scarcity can focus your attention, yes:
    we've all had miraculous work-sprints to meet a deadline.
    But it does so at the expense of thoughtful attention to longer-term (but equally important) priorities:
    that's why we stress-eat,
    skip the gym when our workload is spiking,
    and miss our kids' sports' games when the pressure is on at work. 
  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The comparison between people who are cash-poor and time-poor
  got me thinking about how being <em>skills-poor</em> induces the latter.
  If you don't know how to write a loop,
  you have to do work by hand,
  which takes time away from actually thinking.
  Similarly,
  managing files via creative renaming because nobody has introduced you to version control,
  or re-analyzing data manually instead of re-running a script
  are both taxes on cognition.
  In a sense,
  therefore,
  Software Carpentry's goal is to lower taxes.
  Feel free to use this line of reasoning in your next grant proposal... :-)
