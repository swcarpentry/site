<!-- start excerpt -->
<p>The SCF Steering Committee is undertaking a strategic planning process that will help us to identify the SCF's working priorities for short- and long-term success, based on input from you.</p>

<p>Your input is crucial &ndash; we are beginning the process by asking that you identify key Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT) facing SCF over the next five years via this anonymous survey. We will review the survey results, summarize key issues, and develop a summary and plan that addresses the issues raised. </p>

<p>To help, please fill in <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/o3BIaeVyg0">the SWOT Survey</a>. Note that the survey asks for 3 answers for each strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats but you may fill out more or less as you see fit. Please fill out the survey only once and by August 5, 2015.</p>

<p>For SWOT responses, it would be most helpful if they are text provided as one answer per line. For example, an answer could be:</p>

<p>Coffee is fantastic<br> Candy is tasty<br> Volunteers are handy</p>

<p>Thank you for your help!</p>
