<p>
  There were <a href="{{site.mailing_lists}}/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2015-November/003558.html">two</a>
  <a href="{{site.mailing_lists}}/pipermail/discuss_lists.software-carpentry.org/2015-November/003568.html">threads</a>
  earlier this week about creating new lessons for Software Carpentry,
  which made me realize that
  the process for doing that isn't described anywhere on this site.
</p>
<!-- end excerpt -->
<p>
  First,
  all of our lessons are based on our <a href="{{site.github_url}}/lesson-template">lesson template</a>,
  which includes style files, page layouts, validation tools, and a few other odds and ends.
  It <em>doesn't</em> include starter files or documentation,
  because if it did,
  Git would try to merge those into lessons every time the lessons were updated.
  Instead,
  we have a separate <a href="{{site.github_url}}/lesson-example">lesson example</a> repository
  that describes how lessons are laid out
  and how to create a repository for a new lesson.
</p>
<p>
  Second,
  the <a href="{{page.root}}/lessons.html">lessons page</a> on this site
  has links to the core Software Carpentry lessons
  and to related lessons that other people have written using our template.
  Each lesson has one or more maintainers
  who have volunteered to manage discussion,
  review updates,
  and generally keep the lesson in usable shape.
</p>
<p>
  In order for us to include a lesson on our site,
  it must pass four tests:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
      It must focus on the "how" of research computing rather than the "what".
      Researchers need good lessons on exoplanet detection and the construction of phylogenetic trees,
      and we are pleased to see people use our template to build them,
      but they are out of scope for us.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It must have broad appeal across a range of disciplines.
      In other words,
      if only a few percent of researchers are likely to be interested,
      it's probably not for us.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      It must be compatible with <a href="{{page.root}}/license.html">our license</a>,
      i.e.,
      the text must be CC-BY or CC-0,
      and the software must be available under a permissive open license (such as the MIT or BSD license).
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      Someone must be willing to maintain it.
      Writing the first version of something is exciting;
      keeping it up to date in the months and years that follow is much harder.
    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
  The best way to gauge interest in a potential lesson is to mail our
  <a href="{{page.root}}/pages/join.html">discussion list</a>.
  Before doing that,
  though,
  think about extending the <a href="{{page.root}}/lessons.html#capstones">contributed lessons</a>
  and our <a href="{{page.root}}/lessons.html#v4">retired lessons</a>:
  the former can always use a hand,
  and we'd be very grateful for rewrites of the latter's material on
  <a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/v4/regexp/index.html">regular expressions</a>,
  <a href="{{site.github_io_url}}/v4/media/index.html">image processing</a>,
  and other topics.
</p>
