<p>
Thanks to all the groups that applied for instructor training
that sent great applications.
Select the groups was a very difficult tasks because
</p>
<ul>
    <li>the applications are very good,</li>
    <li>we had a small window to analyse and discuss all the applications,</li>
    <li>we still haven't capacity to support the demand for instructor training.</li>
</ul>
<p>
At the end, we selected the groups lead by
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Alireza Hojjati,</li>
    <li>Anna Ouzounian Williford,</li>
    <li>Daniel Watson Baird,</li>
    <li>Emily Read,</li>
    <li>Fernando Mayer,</li>
    <li>Fotis E. Psomopoulos,</li>
    <li>Madeleine Bonsma,</li>
    <li>Maria Tele≈Ñczuk,</li>
    <li>Martin Hammitzsch,</li>
    <li>Melissa Renee Whitaker.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>We had applications from 44 groups and we accommodate 12 groups
that will be trained by
Christina Koch,
Fiona Tweedie,
Greg Wilson and
Steve Crouch.
</p>

<p>
More than half of the applications come from the US
and we couldn't accommodate 1/3 of those applications
because half of the trainers are in incompatible time zones.
</p>
</p>
Canada is the country with more accepted groups
because we received application from three very small groups
that we merged into one group.
</p>
<p>
In terms of individuals,
we were contacted by more than 200 people
and we accepted 49 to the instructor training in December.
</p>

<p>
The two previous graphs are very similar
what means that in general the demand for instructor training
at each location is the same.
</p>
<p>
Something that some of our instructors could be interested
is in the gender balance of the December Instructor Training.

<h3>Source code anda data</h3>
<p>
The source code for the plots are available
<a href="december-2015-team-selection-announcement.ipynb">here as a Jupyter Notebook</a>
and the CSV files used on it are available
<a href="group-applications.csv">here</a>
and <a href="individual-applications.csv">here</a>.
Both CSV files are a copy of the applications that we receive
<strong>without</strong> names because of privacy concerns.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> We forgot to ask the gender to applicants
so the numbers at the CSV is just a guess based on their names.
