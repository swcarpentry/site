<p>
Thank you to all the teams that applied for instructor training
that sent us applications.
Selection of the teams was a very difficult tasks because
</p>
<ul>
    <li>the applications were excellent</li>
    <li>we had a small amount of time to discuss all the applications,</li>
    <li>we need to improve capacity to support the demand we see for instructor training.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The mentoring committee has selected the teams lead by
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Alireza Hojjati</li>
    <li>Anna Ouzounian Williford</li>
    <li>Daniel Watson Baird</li>
    <li>Emily Read</li>
    <li>Fernando Mayer</li>
    <li>Fotis E. Psomopoulos</li>
    <li>Madeleine Bonsma</li>
    <li>Maria Tele≈Ñczuk</li>
    <li>Martin Hammitzsch</li>
    <li>Melissa Renee Whitaker</li>
</ul>

<h3>Statistics</h3>
<p>We had applications from 44 teams and we could accommodate 12 total teams
that will be trained by
Christina Koch,
Fiona Tweedie,
Greg Wilson and
Steve Crouch.
</p>

<p>
More than half of the applications came from the US.
</p>
</p>
Canada is the country with the highest number of accepted teams
because we received application from three very small teams in close proximity
that we merged into one.
</p>
<p>
In terms of individual applicants,
the teams were comprised of more than 200 people
and we accepted 49 to the instructor training in December.
</p>

<p>
The two previous graphs are very similar
and in general the demand for instructor training
at each location is the same.
</p>
<p>
The below chart shows the gender balance of the December Instructor Training.

<h3>Source code and data</h3>
<p>
The source code for the plots are available
<a href="december-2015-team-selection-announcement.ipynb">here as a Jupyter Notebook</a>
and the CSV files used on it are available
<a href="group-applications.csv">here</a>
and <a href="individual-applications.csv">here</a>.
Both CSV files are a copy of the applications that we received
<strong>without</strong> names because of privacy concerns.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Note:</strong> We forgot to ask the gender to applicants
so the numbers in the CSV is just a guess based on their names.
