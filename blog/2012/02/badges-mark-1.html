<p>One of our key deliverables for the <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2012/01/sloan-foundation-grant-to-software-carpentry-and-mozilla.html">Sloan Foundation-funded work</a> is a <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2012/01/badging.html">badging program</a> built on top of Mozilla's <a href="http://openbadges.org/">Open Badges Initiative</a>. Riffing on our <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2012/02/our-new-look.html">new logo</a>, Carri Han has designed three badges for us:</p>
