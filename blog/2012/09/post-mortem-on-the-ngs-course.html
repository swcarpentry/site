<p>Titus Brown has posted <a href="http://ivory.idyll.org/blog/ngs-2012-course.html">a post-mortem on his Next Generation Sequencing course</a>, and the independent assessment that was done of it. As with <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2012/07/independent-assessment-of-the-past-six-months.html">Jorge Aranda's assessment of Software Carpentry</a>, the results were very positive&mdash;what we and other like-minded people are doing really does make a difference.</p>
