title: Slides and Scripts for the Next Two Episodes
category: ["Content"]
---
<p>I have posted slides and transcripts for the next two lectures on testing, which cover <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/test/unit.html">unit testing with Nose</a>, and <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/test/interface.html">testing interfaces instead of implementations</a>. I was hoping to record the screencasts today, but setting up a new 64-bit desktop machine took longer than expected&mdash;hopefully they'll be up early next week, along with episodes on floating point and setting up fixtures. Comments, as always, would be greatly appreciated.</p>
