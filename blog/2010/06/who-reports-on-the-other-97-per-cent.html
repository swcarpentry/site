title: Who Reports On The Other 97 Per Cent?
category: ["Noticed", "Opinion", "Research"]

<p>The BBC has posted a nice <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/10187248.stm">graphic of the latest Top 500 list</a> of supercomputers around the world. It's pretty impressive, particularly if you're a Linux fan (check out the display by operating system). However, nobody would think that a list of the world's 500 richest people told them much about the state of the economy; I'd be much more interested in statistics on how much computing power is employed by the 97% or so of scientists who <em>don't</em> use a supercomputer.</p>
