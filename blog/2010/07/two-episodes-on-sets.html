title: Two Episodes on Sets
category: ["Content"]
---
<p>I've just posted <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/setdict/intro.html">an introduction to sets</a> in Python, and a brief look at <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/setdict/storage.html">how they're implemented</a> (which you need to know in order to understand why you can't put a list in a set). The second of these has more theory in it than most of our episodes; I'd be grateful for feedback from non-computer scientists about how much sense it makes.</p>
