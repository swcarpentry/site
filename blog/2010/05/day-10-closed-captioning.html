<p>Our latest screencast, on NULL values in SQL, is now online. [Original link no longer active; <a href="{{page.root}}/v4/databases/null.html">more recent screencast on NULL values</a>.] Unlike its predecessors, this one has closed captions (as well as a transcript in the enclosing page). Please let us know what you think: are the captions helpful, or do you find them distracting?</p>
