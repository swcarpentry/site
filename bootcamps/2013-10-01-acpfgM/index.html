<p>
<strong>What:</strong> The bootcamp will run over three full days and consist
of a series of short informal "lectures" and longer hands-on sessions with
opportunities for building networks and collaborations. The bootcamp will cover
topics around the theme of <strong>good programming practices</strong>. Many of
the concepts
covered are exemplified using Python. As such, the first part of day one
teaches/orientates the trainees in Python programming concepts. The second day
teaches concepts of writing tests to demonstrate the behaviour of the code is
as designed/expected as well as the use of version control. The final day is
about putting your newfound skills into practice!
</p>
<p>
<strong>Who:</strong> This boot camp is aimed at bioinformaticians and
computational biologists. As such, attendees will be expected to have working
knowledge of a UNIX/Linux operating system and be competent in at least one
programming/scripting language.
<p>
<strong>Requirements:</strong> No need to bring a laptop; we'll provide
computers and a Virtual Machine (VM) on which you will be working. Lunch and
morning and afternoon tea/coffee/food will also be provided.
