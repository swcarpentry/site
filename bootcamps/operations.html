title: How to Run a Bootcamp
---

<p>
  A bootcamp is an intensive hands-on workshop
  where scientists learn software skills
  through short tutorials and practical exercises.
  A typical bootcamp runs over 2 days with 20-50 attendees,
  2-3 instructors,
  and one helper for every 10 attendees.
  This page explains how to organize and run a bootcamp;
  it is divided into sections according to
  the roles people take on:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    The <a href="#host">host</a>
    (usually a faculty member or equivalent)
    is the principal local contact for the bootcamp.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="#instructor">instructors</a>
    give the lectures and lead the practical exercises.
    The <a href="#lead">lead instructor</a>,
    who is chosen by the Software Carpentry admins,
    is in charge of deciding what will be taught by whom.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#helper">Helpers</a> provide assistance during practical sessions.
    Helpers have often attended a bootcamp themselves at some point,
    and are on the road to becoming instructors.
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#learner">Learners</a> come to the bootcamp to learn.
  </li>
  <li>
    The <a href="#admin">Software Carpentry administrators</a>
    match hosts with instructors,
    set up registration,
    etc.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  We also have some advice on <a href="#mistake">what <em>not</em> to do</a>,
  some <a href="#checklists">checklists</a>,
  a <a href="#faq">FAQ</a> that supplements our <a href="{{page.root}}/faq.html">site-wide FAQ</a>,
  and a <a href="#ad">sample advertisement page</a>.
  Note that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    One person may have several roles in a bootcamp:
    for example,
    it's common for the host to also be a learner.
  </li>
  <li>
    As <a href="{{page.root}}/faq.html#who-can-run-a-bootcamp">explained in our FAQ</a>,
    anyone can use our materials and run a bootcamp.
    However,
    if you want to use our name and logo (which are trademarked),
    the lead instructors must be certified by Software Carpentry
    and certain core topics must be covered.
  </li>
  <li>
    Most importantly,
    we require hosts, instructors, and learners to adhere to our
    <a href="{{page.root}}/conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.
  </li>
</ul>

  <h2>Hosts</h2>

  <p>
    The host's major responsibilities are
    to make a handful of key decisions about the bootcamp,
    and to handle local arrangements.
  </p>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Decide what kind of bootcamp you want</h3>

    <p>
      The first thing you need to decide is your intended audience.
      Can anyone apply or is it restricted to a specific lab, university, or company?
      Do you want to target people in a particular discipline
      (or range of related disciplines),
      or will your bootcamp be open to all?
      You need to decide this early and then stick to it,
      because the type of bootcamp you host will drive other decisions,
      from the topics covered and the room used
      to what follow-up sessions you offer (if any).
    </p>

    <div>
      <h4>Closed vs. Open</h4>
  
      <p>
        A closed bootcamp can be more easily tailored to a specific audience.
        In addition,
        the attendees are more likely to know one another,
        which in our experience means they're less inhibited about asking questions
        and more likely to help each other during practical sessions.
        On the other hand,
        it may be harder to find enough people to fill a bootcamp if you restrict enrollment,
        and if your funding comes from the university or company level,
        it may be politically difficult to turn people away.
      </p>
  
      <p>
        If you choose a closed bootcamp,
        you may have to resist people trying to open it up once enrollment begins.
        If you have good reasons to keep it closed or invite-only,
        keep it that way.
        That said,
        there are good reasons to <a href="#allow-externals">allow externals to come to your bootcamp</a>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Fee or Free</h4>
  
      <p>
        You also need to decide whether your bootcamp is free or not.
        Bootcamps traditionally have been free,
        but we are now frequently charging either a $20 deposit
        (refunded to everyone who attends both days),
        or a flat $20 fee,
        in order to reduce the no-show rate.
        We have found that both strategies reduce the number of no-shows from 20-25% to 5% or less,
        and the money can be used to offset the {{site.admin_overhead}} that we ask for
        to help with central administration overheads.
        Be careful, though:
        as soon as you charge anything at all&mdash;even a refundable deposit&mdash;some
        venues will charge <em>you</em> for use of the space.
      </p>

    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Individual or Team</h4>
  
      <p>
        A third decision is whether learners register indivdiually or in groups.
        Group signup is more difficult to manage than individual signup,
        it also has many benefits,
        including a lower no-show rate and more in-class peer support.
        And while we don't yet have any solid data,
        we believe it increases the likelihood of people using what they've learned
        after the bootcamp is over:
        it's a lot easier for people to put what they've learned into practice
        if everyone in their lab is doing so at the same time.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>Follow-up</h4>
  
      <p>
        Finally,
        you should decide <em>before</em> the bootcamp
        what kind of follow-up you're going to offer (if any).
        Some groups have run weekly lunch-and-learn sessions for a couple of months after a bootcamp
        to help people put what they've learned into action.
        Other groups have set up mailing lists,
        and we've tried running online tutorials as well
        (though with disappointing results).
        Whatever you decide to do,
        figure it out in advance so that you can tell learners about it at least a couple of times.
      </p>
    </div>

  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Secure funding</h3>
  
    <p>
      Our instructors are volunteers,
      and do not need to be paid for their time,
      but bootcamp hosts are expected to cover their travel and accommodation costs.
      (As far as possible,
      we try to match instructors to nearby sites in order to reduce these,
      but please see <a href="#pay-instructor-costs">why you should pay instructors' expenses</a>).
      We also ask hosts to contribute {{site.admin_overhead}} per bootcamp toward central overheads,
      including curriculum development,
      instructor training,
      website maintenance,
      and administrative overheads.
      This puts the total cost for a bootcamp in the $2000-4000 range,
      depending on instructors' travel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some possible sources of funding are:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
        "Miscellaneous" funds
        (e.g., a couple of thousand dollars in a faculty member's grant).
        This is by far the most common case.
      </li>
      <li>
        Training budgets at the lab, department, or institutional level.
      </li>
      <li>
        Workshop budgets set aside as part of conferences.
      </li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>
      You may also want to consider these
      <a href="#ways-to-reduce-costs">ways to reduce the costs of running your bootcamp</a>.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      It's much easier for us if instructors deal directly with host sites for reimbursement,
      but in complicated cases
      (e.g., several people traveling to do several bootcamps,
      with costs shared between several sites),
      we can act as an intermediary.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Choose dates</h3>
  
    <p>
      Many factors determine when to hold your bootcamp.
      The first is obviously the availability of instructors:
      the admins will help you with this.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      If you hold the bootcamp at a university,
      keep in mind that the start of term works better the end of term
      (when people are tired, and busy with final assignments and exams),
      and that the start of the second (or subsequent) term works better for graduate students
      than the start of first term
      (the start of an academic year is busy anyway,
      and by their second term most students have a better idea of their research problem's programming needs).
      In our experience mid-term breaks and reading weeks have <em>not</em> worked well:
      bootcamps held then usually have high no-show rates.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      You could also schedule a bootcamp immediately before or after a conference
      (or run it as a tutorial within a conference)
      to target people from a specific discipline.
      If you do this,
      involve the conference organizers early and often.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      You and the lead instructor must also decide when you'll start and end each day
      and when breaks and lunch will be.
      A later start on the first day
      (e.g., 09:30 instead of 09:00)
      gives people who don't live nearby a better chance of being there for the start,
      but leaves less time for learning.
      Similarly,
      an earlier end (e.g., 16:30 instead of 17:00) allows non-locals time to travel home.
      Some attendees may also have child-care needs;
      it's worth asking about this by email before the bootcamp starts
      so that people can respond one-to-one if they want to.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Book space</h3>
  
    <p>
      You'll need a room with:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Front-facing tables</strong>
        so that attendees can watch an instructor and use their laptop at the same time.
        (Typing on a laptop for two days in theater-style seating can cause back strain.)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>High-speed WiFi or network access</strong>
        that can withstand everyone using it at the same time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Power outlets</strong>
        for all the computers.
        This often involves extension cords;
        if you're doing that,
        make sure they're taped down.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Space for mingling</strong>
        without squeezing between chairs and tripping over cables.
        This is <em>essential</em>:
        if helpers cannot reach learners who are having problems quickly and easily,
        those learners will fall further and further behind as the day goes on.
        Again,
        theater-style lecture rooms are not recommended
        as their banked floors and fixed seating makes it very difficult for helpers to mingle.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>A microphone</strong>
        if the room is large or has poor acoustics,
        or if you are recording the lesson.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Disabled access.</strong>
        (Make sure the washrooms are accessible as well&hellip;)
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Air-conditioning,</strong>
        because all those computers (and attendees) will generate a lot of heat.
      </li>
      <li>
	<strong>Space to serve coffee and snacks</strong>,
	because learning is hungry work.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Set up registration</h3>

    <p>
      The Software Carpentry administrators will usually take care of this,
      but some sites do use their own system:
      for example,
      bootcamps being run in conjunction with conferences
      may use the conference registration system.
    </p>

  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Recruit helpers</h3>
  
    <p>
      Most of our helpers are scientists who have either gone through a previous bootcamp,
      or learned most of what we teach on our own.
      You can usually recruit them locally from your own and nearby institutions,
      and should have at least one helper for every ten attendees.
      Most bootcamps don't cover helpers' travel or accommodation expenses,
      but taking them out to dinner the day before the bootcamp starts
      is a nice way to thank them
      (and gives them a chance to meet the instructors).
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Advertise</h3>
  
    <p>
      The <a href="#lead">lead instructor</a> for the bootcamp
      will create a web page with instructions for attendees,
      including the dates, the site, a link to register, and so on.
      Pleas check this and make sure it includes local travel information,
      parking instructions,
      and whatever else is needed.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Once this page is set up,
      start spreading the word about the bootcamp.
      We can provide advice on how to do this,
      and are happy to publish your blog articles and tweets to our followers.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      If you plan to photograph, record, or broadcast your bootcamp
      then mention this on its web page.
      Your institution may require you to obtain a signed photo release
      from each person if pictures are being taken.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Tweet and blog about the event and send emails to departmental mailing lists,
      discipline-specific mailing lists,
      specific people (e.g., lab directors or principal investigators),
      and anyone else who you think will be interested.
      Remember to include links to the bootcamp's website.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Arrange catering</h3>
  
    <p>
      If you can afford to provide coffee and snacks for attendees, do so:
      it cuts the time per coffee break to 10-15 minutes from 20-25 minutes.
      If you cannot do this,
      make sure that there is somewhere nearby where attendees can get refreshments,
      and schedule time accordingly.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are providing snacks,
      try to allow for allergies and other dietary restrictions.
      Please also make sure attendees have been told
      whether they can bring drinks and snacks into the room being used for the class.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Select attendees</h3>
  
    <p>
      If you are using something other than first-come/first-served registration,
      select the attendees you want to attend and let them know they have a seat.
      Ask them to tell you as soon as possible if they can't make the bootcamp,
      so that you can offer their place to someone else.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Once registration is complete,
      email attendees to have them set up their computers as described above.
      Email people who didn't make it into your selection
      to let them know that they'll be held on a on a waiting list just in case an attendee drops out.
    </p>

    <p>
      If there is a waiting list a week before the event,
      you may want to invite a few people to turn up just in case there are no-shows.
      If there are still empty seats at mid-morning on the first day,
      then they're welcome to stay.
      If not,
      they're welcome to come back for the next one,
      but make it clear <em>before </em>they arrive that their participation is not guaranteed.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Gather your gear</h3>
  
    <p>
      Collect the equipment listed in the <a href="#checklists">checklist</a>
      at least a day before the start of the bootcamp.
    </p>
  
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Report back</h3>
  
    <p>
      Once the bootcamp is over,
      please send feedback to the Software Carpentry administrators
      about how it went.
      Was it the right content?
      The right pace?
      Did it seem well organized,
      or were there things we could improve?
      What did you hear from learners afterward,
      and would you like us to visit you again?
    </p>
  
  </div>
</div>

<div id="instructor">
  <h2>Instructors</h2>
  
  <p>
    Your job is to lecture and lead practical exercises.
    You should also help learners during practical sessions,
    but remember to rest your voice as well:
    two days is a lot of talking.
    You <em>don't</em> need to know all of the material well enough to teach it
    (as long as one of your co-instructors does),
    but it helps,
    particularly if someone can't make it at the last minute.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    The most important thing is to remember that
    no lesson plan survives contact with the audience.
    Whether it's the network going down
    or the sudden realization that many of your learners <em>don't</em> know how to use SSH,
    you will frequently need to improvise.
    Even without hiccups like those,
    try your best to adjust your pace and examples based on
    learners' questions, puzzled looks, and sighs of impatience.
  </p>
  
  <div class="well">
    <h3>Before</h3>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>
        Arrange travel to the bootcamp site,
        accommodation,
        and transportation from wherever you're staying to wherever you're teaching.
        Save your receipts!
      </li>
      <li>
        Work through your own setup instructions to make sure they're complete,
        and so that you have the same setup as your learners.
      </li>
      <li>
        Work with the <a href="#lead">lead instructor</a> to figure out who's teaching what and when.
	Make sure you allow 15-30 minutes on the morning of the first day for installation and setup:
	no matter how often you tell people to get their machines ready before they arrive,
	some will not have done so,
	or will have run into problems that they're not yet able to fix.
	(You can offer office hours for setup help before the bootcamp,
	but our experience is that few people take advantage of them.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose or prepare your lessons, data sets, cheat sheets, exercises, and version control repositories.
      </li>
      <li>
        Try out your examples and exercises to make sure they (still) work.
      </li>
      <li>
        Post your exercises and cheat sheets on your bootcamp's web site
        so that students can refer to them.
        (The <a href="#admin">admins</a> or the <a href="#lead">lead instructor</a>
        will create a GitHub repository for the bootcamp,
        which also hosts its web pages.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Put your data sets on your bootcamp's web site for downloading.
      </li>
      <li>
        Familiarize yourself with the material your fellow instructors will be presenting,
        just in case one of them pulls out.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div class="well">
    <h3>On the day</h3>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>
        If you are using multiple windows (e.g., a command window and an editor window)
        make sure they are both large enough to be visible by all attendees.
        Remember to pause when switching from one window to the other
        so that learners don't become confused.
        If possible,
        use different background colors for different text windows
        to make it easier for learners to tell them apart
        (but keep in mind red-green and blue-yellow color blindness).
      </li>
      <li>
        As you type at the command line,
        read out what you're typing.
        Remember that most learners can only go half as fast as you,
        because they have to watch you type,
        then type it all in again themselves.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use Etherpad to share small data sets, snippets of code, and commands with learners.
      </li>
      <li>
        Encourage learners to take notes about what they're learning in the Etherpad.
        This reduces the effort per learner,
        gives you a chance to see what they think you're saying,
        and provides a record after the bootcamp of what was actually taught.
      </li>
      <li>
        Back up the material with your own anecdotes, experiences and evidence&mdash;it
        makes you more credible,
        helps learners understand how to apply what you're teaching to their own problems,
        and prevents the lectures from becoming too dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Emphasise that good software development skills contribute to productive, reproducible, reusable research.
      </li>
      <li>
        For every question with a binary answer (yes/no, have done/have not done, works/does not work),
        ask learners to hold up green (yes) or red (no) sticky notes
        to help you gauge their level of understanding.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you ask attendees to do a practical exercise,
        have them post a red note on their laptop if they run into trouble
        and a green one when they have a solution.
        This lets you gauge how learners are progressing,
        and lets helpers see who needs their assistance.

        Create the GitHub repository that will host the bootcamp's web pages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Create the home page for the bootcamp in that repository,
        and either write or recycle a description of the curriculum
        and setup instructions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sort out who's teaching what.
	This usually takes a few iterations,
	so don't leave it until the last minute.
	(You'll know you're done when you can create a schedule for your bootcamp
	with instructors' names against each topic being taught.)
      </li>

  <p>
    In almost all cases,
    learners want to use their own laptops during bootcamps
    so that they leave with a working environment set up.
    Even if you ask attendees to prepare beforehand,
    and give them detailed instructions,
    some will not and some won't be able to.
    You should therefore schedule time for <em>checking the learners' machines</em>
    at the beginning of the first day
    to save you from repeating the same thing individually to each attendee.
  </p>
      <li>
        Create an Etherpad to use as you teach,
        or have the admins create one for you.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make sure the pre-assessment questionnaire has been sent to your learners
        and share the responses with your fellow instructors.
      </li>
      <li>
	Encourage instructors to do a dry-run before the bootcamp
	to check that everything they plan to teach is working.
	This is especially important if it is their first time teaching:
	<em>everyone</em> over-estimates how much they'll be able to cover
	the first time they present,
	and a dry run helps reduce this problem.

    <h3>On the day</h3>
    <ul class="checklist">
      <li>
        Circulate a sign-in sheet so we can tell who actually attended.
      </li>
      <li>
        Just before each break,
        have learners write down one good point on their green sticky
        and one bad one on their red sticky
        and hand them in.
        It only takes a couple of minutes to sort through these,
        and it quickly tells you whether you're going too fast or too slow,
        whether you need to review some material after the break,
        etc.
        If you can,
        put each batch of sticky notes into an envelope
        and send them to us
        so that we can look for patterns.
      </li>
      <li>
        At the end of the bootcamp,
        ask each person in the room to give you one good point or one bad one
        without repeating anything someone else has already said.
        Please send us this feedback as well so that we can look for patterns.

    As a helper, your job is to help the attendees during practical sessions.

        and how to apply them both to teaching computational competence to scientists.
      </li>

<div id="admin">
  <h2>Administrators</h2>

  <p>
    The Software Carpentry administrators are responsible for
    coordinating the other people involved in the bootcamp
    and managing things like registration and assessment.
  </p>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Recruit instructors</h3>
  
    <p>
      You will need at least two instructors for each room of approximately 40 people,
      and a third is always a good idea:
    </p>
  
    <ul>
      <li>
	It's too much to ask a single person to talk for eight hours a day for two days.
      </li>
      <li>
	Attendees will be more engaged if they hear from more than one person.
      </li>
      <li>
	Things can always go wrong at the last moment,
	so having two or three instructors reduces the risk of having to cancel
	because of illness,
	travel mishaps,
	etc.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Recruit instructors <em>before</em> advertising the bootcamp or opening up registration.
      As noted in the introduction,
      at least one instructor must be certified by Software Carpentry
      in order for the bootcamp to use our name and logo.
      The other instructors should have prior teaching experience,
      be doing the <a href="{{page.root}}/faq.html#how-become-instructor">instructor training</a>,
      or have helped with at least one previous bootcamp.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Travel arrangements and reimbursement</h3>
  
    <p>
      Make sure the instructors have made travel arrangements.
      If there is someone at the host institution who regularly handles this,
      connect them with instructors as soon as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      You shuld also make sure it's clear who's paying for what,
      and how people will be reimbursed,
      <em>before</em> anyone buys plane tickets.
      We strongly prefer sites to reimburse instructors directly
      rather than routing payments through Software Carpentry.
    </p>

    <p>
      Equally important is to get confirmation that the host site will contribute
      {{site.admin_overhead}} (or whatever has been agreed)
      to central administration overheads,
      and to sort out how this will be done.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Set up registration</h3>
  
    <p>
      Find out if the host expects to use their in-house registration system.
      If so, let them handle registration.
      If not,
      we recommend <a href="http://www.eventbrite.com/">EventBrite</a>,
      and we are happy to host registrations on <a href="http://software-carpentry.eventbrite.com/">our account</a>.
      Either way,
      make sure you enable a waiting list,
      because bootcamps are very popular.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Web Site</h3>
  
    <p>
      The <a href="#lead">lead instructor</a> and other instructors
      are responsible for creating the bootcamp's home page on GitHub.
      Make sure that they have done this,
      and that the metadata headers in their <code>index.html</code> page are correct.
      (The <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc">instructions on creating bootcamp pages</a>
      explain how to do this.)
      Also check that the bootcamp is showing up properly in
      our <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/index.html">bootcamp index page</a>.
      Once the bootcamp page is set up,
      tweet and blog about the event.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Set up a mailing list</h3>
  
    <p>
      Set up a mailing list for organizers, lecturers, and helpers
      as soon as your bootcamp is confirmed
      so that you can inform everyone about the latest news,
      organize who's teaching what,
      etc.
      You may also set up a mailing list for attendees,
      but we have found it's easier to use the registration system
      to broadcast information as needed.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="well">
    <h3>Send out the pre-assessment</h3>
    <p>
      Make sure registrants have completed our standard questionnaire.
      This is part of the EventBrite sign-up process,
      but if the host is using their institution's registration system,
      you will need to clone our Google Docs template.

  <h2>What <em>Not</em> To Do</h2>
  
  <p>
    No discussion of how to teach a bootcamp would be complete without some discussion of what <em>not</em> to do.
    To that end, here are a few common mistakes.
  </p>

  <dl>

    <dt>Bore them.</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
	Your audience will never care more about what you're teaching than you appear to,
	so if they get the feeling you're not interested in it,
	they won't be either.
	This does <em>not</em> mean you have to shout,
	crack three jokes a minute,
	or harangue them about how this stuff is really, really important,
	but you do owe it to your audience to show up mentally as well as physically.
      </p>
    </dd>
  
    <dt>Ignore them.</dt>  
    <dd>
      <p>
	You're not there to reproduce one of our online videos in person:
	you're there to interact with people so that they get a better learning experience.
	You shouldn't ever go more than two or three minutes without asking a question (and listening to the answer),
	and if it has been 15 minutes since any of your learners asked one,
	odds are you've either lost them or are boring them.
      </p>
    </dd>
  
    <dt>Let them ignore each other.</dt>  
    <dd>
      <p>
	Done right,
	Software Carpentry bootcamps are a great networking opportunity for our learners (and for us, too).
	If you don't know half your learners by name at the end of two days,
	you're doing it wrong;
	if they haven't each made at least half a dozen new contacts,
	that's your fault too.
	Have them work in pairs, and require them to mix up the pairs at least a couple of times.
	Equally, encourage them to chat to one another at coffee breaks and lunch,
	and to get a pizza or some curry together for dinner on the first day.
      </p>
    </dd>
  
    <dt>All talk, no action.</dt>  
    <dd>
      <p>
	The more time folks spend with their hands on the keyboards doing exercises,
	the more time they're actually paying attention.
	The students have their computers in front of them:
	if you talk for more than five minutes without asking them to use their computers, they'll do so anyway&mdash;on Facebook.
      </p>
    </dd>
  
    <dt>Use magic.</dt>  
    <dd>
      <p>
	Typing too fast, using shortcuts or commands they haven't seen yet&mdash;basically,
	any time you say, "Don't worry about this just now,"
	or they say, "Wait, how did you do that?" or, "Can you please slow down, I can't keep up,"
	you're no longer actually helping them.
      </p>
    </dd>
  
    <dt>Don't close the loop.</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
	You can't optimize without feedback, so:
      </p>
      <ul class="checklist">
	<li>
	  Give them all red and green sticky notes so that they can put up a green one when they're finished an exercise,
	  and a red one when they have a question or need setup help.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Have them write down good and bad points before each break
	  so that you can tell right away what you're doing right and wrong.
	</li>
	<li>
	  Make sure to leave at least 20 minutes at the end of the final day for feedback
	  (whether it's a verbal "one good/one bad" report,
	  filling in an online survey,
	  or whatever else you're using).
	</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
	And remember: feedback is pointless if you don't pay attention to it (or worse, if you explain it away).
	There's no point collecting feedback after each bootcamp if you don't change what and how you teach to reflect it.
      </p>
    </dd>
  
    <dt>Don't master the material yourself.</dt>  
    <dd>
      <p>
	It's OK to make mistakes and not know things&mdash;in fact,
	stumbling in front of your learners and then picking yourself up is a great teaching opportunity.
	But if they believe you don't have a solid grasp of the concepts underlying the material you're teaching,
	they will have less confidence in everything you say, even when you're right.
      </p>
    </dd>
  
    <dt>Don't tell them "why".</dt>  
    <dd>
      <p>
	Most of our learners are graduate students in science and engineering,
	so they know what evidence looks like, and why working practices should be evidence-based.
	That doesn't mean you have to have the whole of empirical software engineering at your fingertips in order to teach,
	but please do read
	<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Facts-Fallacies-Software-Engineering-Robert/dp/0321117425/"><cite>Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering</cite></a>
	and sprinkle a few of the findings it quotes into your lessons.
      </p>
    </dd>
  
    <dt>Show them the forest but not the trees.</dt>  
    <dd>
      <p>
	The things we teach reinforce each other,

	Point out that connecting things with pipes in the shell is like chaining functions together,

  <h2>FAQ</h2>

  <dl class="faq">

    <dt id="pay-instructor-costs">Why should I pay instructor travel and accomodation costs?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
	There are several reasons why we ask hosts to pay for instructors' travel and accomodation costs:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
          Instructors give their time for free,
	  but are usually not able to pay for their own travel.
	</li>
	<li>
          It may be more difficult to get instructors to come to your bootcamp if you don't,
	  as you're making them pay to deliver a service to you.
	</li>
	<li>
          "Host pays costs" is essential to Software Carpentry's sustainability.
	</li>
	<li>
          Paying only travel and accommodation expenses is still a lot cheaper than recruiting a private training organisation.
          And, unlike those, Software Carpentry is designed specifically to meet the needs of researchers.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt id="ways-to-reduce-costs">How can I reduce bootcamp costs?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
	There are a number of ways you might want to consider to reduce the 
	cost of running a bootcamp:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
          Use your professional network to see if there are others in your
          institution or community who are willing to help with instructor
          travel expenses, room bookings or other costs. They may be willing
          to share costs if their researchers can attend your bootcamp&hellip;
	</li>
	<li>
          &hellip;or just go all-out and agree to run one jointly.
	</li>
	<li>
          Use local instructors and helpers (by local we mean from within your
          institution, region or country) who will have lower travel costs.
	</li>
	<li>
          Co-locate with conferences or workshops being run by your 
          institution or within your community.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>

    <dt id="allow-externals">Why should I allow externals to come to a bootcamp I'm paying for?</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
	There are a number of reasons why you might want to consider allowing
	externals to come to your bootcamp, whether they be researchers
	wishing to learn software development skills or potential hosts who
	want to see how one is run:
      </p>
      <ul>
	<li>
          Others can see how a bootcamp is run and so decide whether they want to run one too,
	  which contributes to the growth and sustainability of Software Carpentry.
	</li>
	<li>
          Attendees are given the opportunity to network and build relationships
	  with researchers from elsewhere within your institution or community,
	  or foster cross-disciplinary collaboration.
	</li>
	<li>
          Your profile is raised within your institution or community as one experienced in hosting bootcamps
	  which means others may seek your advice when they come to run theirs.
	</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Sample Bootcamp Advertisement</h2>
  <pre>
We are running a Software Carpentry bootcamp here at Euphoric
State University on January 1-2, 2014, and would like to invite
you attend.  Software Carpentry's aim is to teach researchers
basic computing concepts and skills so that they can get more done
in less time, and with less pain.  Our curriculum includes

  Day 1 a.m.: Introduction to Unix shell.
  Day 2 p.m.: Version control plus an introduction to databases and SQL.
  Day 2 a.m.: Introduction to programming with Python.
  Day 2 p.m.: More on Python plus testing and reproducible research.

Our instructors are scientists like yourselves: Dr. Nelle Nemo is a
marine biologist who has just returned from a six-month survey
gelatinous marine life in the North Pacific Gyre, and Carla Climate is
a post-doc in meteorology studying climate change in the Northern and
Southern hemispheres.

Software Carpentry's teaching is hands-on, so participants are
required to bring their own laptops.  (We will provide instructions on
setting up the required software several days in advance.)  You will
also be asked to complete a pre-assessment as part of the registration
process so that instruction can be tailored to your needs and skills.

The cost for the bootcamp is only $40. To register, please go to:

  http://eventbrite.com/something

or see http://some.other.url for information about this bootcamp in
particular, or http://software-carpentry.org for information about
Software Carpentry.  If you would like more information, please email
someone@somewhere.com.

We look forward to seeing you there!
Thanks,

    </p>
    <p>Instructors: Nelle Nemo and Carla Climate.</p>

    <p>
      <strong>What:</strong>
      Our goal is to help scientists and engineers become more productive
      by teaching them basic computing skills like program design, version
      control, testing, and task automation. In this two-day boot camp,
      short tutorials will alternate with hands-on practical
      exercises. Participants will be encouraged both to help one another,
      and to apply what they have learned to their own research problems
      during and between sessions. Attendants are offered online office hours: 
      regular events to get one-on-one help from Software Carpentry instructors, 
      online.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Who:</strong>
      The course is aimed at postgraduate students and other scientists
      who are familiar with basic programming concepts (like loops,
      conditionals, arrays, and functions) but need help to translate this
      knowledge into practical tools to help them work more
      productively.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Requirements:</strong>
      Participants must bring a laptop with a few specific software
      packages installed. (The list will be sent to participants a week
      before the boot camp.)
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Content:</strong> The syllabus for this boot camp will include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>using the shell to do more in less time</li>
      <li>using version control to manage and share information</li>
      <li>basic Python programming</li>
      <li>using databases and SQL</li>
      <li>how (and how much) to test programs</li>
      <li>how to make computational results trackable and reproducible</li>
    </ul>
