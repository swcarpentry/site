title: Bootcamp Checklist &mdash; Lead Instructor
---
<p>
  Along with the <a
    href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/instructors.html">usual
    duties of an instructor</a>,
  lead instructors are responsible
  for leading discussions among the instructors and host about what to teach
  and who's teaching what.
  They are also responsible for making sure that
  the bootcamp's web page and repository are set up in good time,
  and for handling evaluation.
</p>

<p>
  All of these duties can be delegated,
  but it's the lead instructor's responsibility to make sure they are done.
  If you've been assigned the lead instructor role 
  but aren't comfortable with it,
  or find that you don't have time,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">let Software Carpentry admin know</a>
  as soon as possible.
</p>

  <h4>Initial Preparation</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Look at the 
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/instructors.html">instructors' checklist</a>:
      all of those items apply to the lead instructor too.
    </li>
    <li>
      Talk to the boot camp host about the boot camp audience
      and their desired curriculum and level.
      Talk to the bootcamp host about the audience;
      what field(s) are they from, 
      and what is their expertise level,
      and what curriculum would interest them?
    </li>
    <li>
      With the other instructors, decide:
      <ul>
        <li>what content to cover,</li>
        <li>what the schedule will be, and</li>
        <li>who will teach what.</li>
      </ul>
      This usually takes a few iterations, so don't leave it until the last
      minute.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create a schedule for your bootcamp
      with instructors' names against each topic being taught.
      Be sure to allow enough 
      time to set up
      on the first day,
      and for learners to fill in the post-bootcamp assessment on the last day.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create the <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc">GitHub
        repository</a>
      that will host the bootcamp's web pages.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create the home page for the bootcamp in that repository,
      and either write or recycle a description of the curriculum
      and setup instructions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create an Etherpad for the bootcamp.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you're local to the bootcamp site,
      suggest some helpers if you can.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once Software Carpentry admin has set up the bootcamp's mailing list,
      introduce yourself to the helpers,
      give them the setup instructions,
      and let them know the bootcamp schedule and curriculum.
    </li>
    <li>
      Consult the 
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/instructors.html">instructors' checklist</a>:
      all of those tasks apply to the lead instructor too.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>A Week or Two Before</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Make sure the pre-bootcamp assessment questionnaire has been created
      and sent to your learners,
      and share the responses with your fellow instructors.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure all the instructors have posted their materials
      on the bootcamp web site.
    </li>
    <li>
      Contact the helpers to see if they have any questions
      and remind them to arrive 15 minutes early.
    </li>
    <li>
      Ask a helper keep an eye on the clock during the bootcamp:
      if the instructor has been talking for 15 minutes
      without asking learners to do anything,
      the helper should remind the instructor that it's time for an exercise.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h4>First-Day Welcome</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Make sure all learners are set up correctly and have sticky notes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remind learners of the bootcamp's goals and schedule.
    </li>
  </ul>

<div class="well">
  <h4>During the Boot Camp</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Before each break,
      have learners 
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#feedback">submit
        feedback</a>
      on their sticky notes. 
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
  
<div class="well">
  <h4>At the End</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ask for feedback (one good thing and one bad thing) 
      and send it to Software Carpentry.
      You can collect it on sticky notes,
      on the Etherpad,
      or with a Google form.
      <!-- FIXME: or should this be part of the post-bootcamp assessment? -->
    </li>
    <li>
      Distribute the post-bootcamp assessment.
      It's best if learners complete it before they leave.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>After</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Fill in the workshop summary questionnaire
      to let Software Carpentry admin know what was actually taught
      and how it went.
      <!--FIXME need link for instructor post-bootcamp questionnaire -->
