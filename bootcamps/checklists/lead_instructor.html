title: Boot Camp Checklist &mdash; Lead Instructor
---
<p>
  Along with their usual instructional duties,
  lead instructors are responsible
  for leading discussions among the instructors and host about what to teach
  and who's teaching what.
  They are also responsible for making sure that
  the boot camp's web page and repository are set up in good time,
  and for handling evaluation.
</p>

<p>
  All of these duties can be delegated,
  but that it's the lead instructor's responsibility to make sure they are done.
  If you have been assigned the lead instructor role but aren't comfortable with it,
  or find that you don't have time,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">let the Software Carpentry administrator know</a>
  as soon as possible.
</p>

  <h3>Initial Preparation</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Look at the 
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/checklists/instructor.html">instructors' checklist</a>:
      all of those items apply to the lead instructor too.
    </li>
    <li>
      Talk to the boot camp host about the boot camp audience
      and their desired curriculum and level.
    </li>
    <li>
      With the other instructors, decide:
      <ul>
        <li>what content to cover,</li>
        <li>what the schedule will be, and</li>
        <li>who will teach what.</li>
      </ul>
      You'll know you're done when you can create a schedule for your boot camp
      with instructors' names against each topic being taught.
      Be sure to allow enough 
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#lead_setup">time to set up</a>
      on the first day,
      and for learners to fill in the post-assessment on the last day.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create the <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc">GitHub repository</a>
      that will host the boot camp's web pages.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create the home page for the boot camp in that repository,
      and either write or recycle a description of the curriculum
      and setup instructions.
    </li>
    <li>
      Create an Etherpad to use as you teach.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you're local to the boot camp site,
      suggest some helpers for the boot camp.
    </li>
    <li>
      Once the Software Carpentry admin has set up the boot camp's mailing list,
      introduce yourself to the helpers
      and let them know the boot camp schedule and curriculum.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h3>A Week or Two Before</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Make sure the pre-assessment questionnaire has been created
      and sent to your learners,
      and share the responses with your fellow instructors.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure all the instructors have posted their materials
      on the boot camp web site.
    </li>
    <li>
      Contact the helpers to see if they have any questions
      and remind them to arrive 15 minutes early.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
  
<div class="well">
  <h3>First-Day Welcome</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Make sure all learners are set up correctly and have sticky notes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Remind learners of the boot camp's goals and schedule.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h3>During the Boot Camp</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Have a helper keep an eye on the clock:
      if the instructor has been talking for 15 minutes
      without asking learners to do anything,
      the helper should clear her throat noisily,
      tap her nose with her finger,
      or otherwise remind the instructor that it's time for an exercise.
    </li>
    <li>
      Before each break,
      have learners <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#lead_stickies">submit feedback</a>
      on their sticky notes. 
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
  
<div class="well">
  <h3>At the End</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ask for feedback (one good thing and one bad thing) 
      and send it to Software Carpentry.
      You can collect it on sticky notes,
      on the Etherpad,
      or with a Google form.
      <!-- FIXME: or should this be part of the post-assessment? -->
    </li>
    <li>
      Distribute the post-assessment.
      It's best if learners complete it before they leave.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h3>After</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Fill in the workshop summary questionnaire
      so that the administrators know what was actually taught
      and how it went.
      <!--FIXME need link-->
    </li>
  </ul>
