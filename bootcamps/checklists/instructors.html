title: Boot Camp Checklist &mdash; Instructors
---

<p>
  Instructors lecture and lead practical exercises.
  You should also help learners during practical sessions,
  but remember to rest your voice as well.
  You <em>don't</em> need to know the curriculum
  for all the topics in your boot camp,
  but it certainly helps
  (particularly if someone can't make it at the last minute).
</p>
  
<div class="well">
  <h3>Before</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Arrange travel to the boot camp site,
      accommodation,
      and transportation from wherever you're staying 
      to wherever you're teaching.
    </li>
    <li>
      Find out (from the host) how to be reimbursed for travel expenses.
    </li>
    <li>
      Work with the <a href="operations.html#lead">lead instructor</a> to figure out 
      who's teaching what and when.
    </li>
    <li>
      Choose or prepare your lessons,
      data sets,
      cheat sheets, 
      exercises,
      and version control repositories.
    </li>
    <li>
      Post your exercises, data sets, and cheat sheets
      on the boot camp's web site.
      (The lead instructor
      will create a GitHub repository
      to host the boot camp's web pages.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Work through your own setup instructions to make sure they're complete,
      and to ensure that you have the same setup as your learners.
    </li>
    <li>
      Try out your examples and exercises to make sure they (still) work.
    </li>
    <li>
      Familiarize yourself with the material your fellow instructors will be presenting,
      in case one of them pulls out or loses their voice.
    </li>
    <li>
      Review 
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#instructors_practices">good instruction practices</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Familiarize yourself with
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#instructors_pitfalls">common pitfalls</a>.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
  
<div class="well">
  <h3>After the Boot Camp</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Complete the instructors' post-assessment.
    </li>
    <li>
      Send any other feedback you have
      to the Software Carpentry administrator.
    </li>
    <li>
      Upload improvements to common lesson material to GitHub
      and send a pull request to the master repository.
    </li>
  </ul>
