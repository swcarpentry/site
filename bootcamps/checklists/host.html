title: Boot Camp Checklist &mdash; Host
---

<p>
  A boot camp host is a person (or group of people)
  who would like to arrange a boot camp at their university,
  research lab,
  company,
  conference,
  or other venue.
</p>

<div class="well">
  <h3>Getting Started</h3>
  <p>
    If you're considering hosting a boot camp,
    think about:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Who will the audience be?
      Will the boot camp be open to
      people in your lab,
      in your department,
      at your university or company,
      attending a conference,
      or anyone nearby?
    </li>
    <li>
      Where it will be?
      Is a <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_venue">good venue</a> available?
      Will it cost anything to book?
    </li>
    <li>
      When it will be?
      Lots of factors will affect
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_when">when you can hold your boot camp</a>;
      think about what makes sense for you and your audience.
      Be flexible,
      because instructor availability at our end will be a factor too.
    </li>
    <li>
      How will you fund it?
      The <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_cost">cost of running a boot camp</a>
      includes instructors' travel and lodging,
      the Software Carpentry administration fee, 
      the cost of booking the room,
      and catering.
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The answers to those questions will determine:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_who">Who will be permitted to attend the boot camp?</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_charge">What will it cost to attend the boot camp (if anything)?</a></li>
    <li><a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_followup">What kind of follow-up will be offered?</a></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    After you've thought about all that,
    <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">contact Software Carpentry</a>
    and let us know:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      your location and institution;
    </li>
    <li>
      your potential dates;
    </li>
    <li>
      the likely audience (research field, previous computing experience); and
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_numbers">how many learners</a> you're expecting.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">  
  <h3>Finalize Details</h3>
  <p>
    Together with the Software Carpentry administrator:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Find <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_instructors">two or three instructors</a> per room.
    </li>
    <li>
      Set a date.
    </li>
    <li>
      Set up registration (if you are handling this yourself)
      or make sure Software Carpentry administration has
      the <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_registration">information needed</a>
      to set up an Eventbrite registration page.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h3>Local Coordination</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Book a room, keeping in mind the <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_room">ideal room characteristics</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Recruit <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_helpers">helpers</a>.</li>
    <li>
      Communicate with instructors about the boot camp content and audience.
      (The Software Carpentry administrator will set up a mailing list for you,
      your instructors,
      and the helpers.)
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are restricting registration to a particular audience,
      monitor registration.
      (Administration will give you access to the Eventbrite event.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Book <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_catering">catering</a>
      (if you are supplying coffee and snacks)
      or find out where the nearest coffee shop is.
    </li>
    <li>
      Obtain or locate <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_equipment">all necessary gear</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Confirmthat instructors have booked their travel,
      and they know how to submit receipts for reimbursement.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h3>A Week Before</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Email boot camp registrants and tell them:
      <ul>
        <li>
	  to visit the boot camp web page for setup information,
          boot camp location,
	  etc.
	  Emphasize the importance of setting up their computers well in advance.
	</li>
        <li>
	  to let us know if they can't come to the boot camp.
	  (They can't cancel their own registration on Eventbrite&mdash;they have to email you or the Software Carpentry admin.)
	</li>
        <li>
	  anything else they need to know about the location, parking, etc.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If there are cancellations,
      offer those spaces to people on the waiting list.
      (Eventbrite doesn't do this automatically.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Plan dinner or drinks with the helpers and instructors the evening before the boot camp,
      if possible.
    </li>
    <li>
      Find out where the bathrooms are,
      how to work the air conditioning,
      and who to call if something goes wrong with the facility or network.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure security will be expecting you and the doors will be unlocked.
    </li>
    <li>
      Print out sign-in sheets.
    </li>
    <!-- FIXME: We need printable sign-in sheets. -->

    </li>
    <li>
      Remind helpers to mingle and encourage conversation
      as well as answer questions and debug setup problems.
      <!-- FIXME: not really the host responsibility? should be lead instructor -->
    </li>
    <li>
      As learners arrive,
      ask them to connect to the network
      and check that they have software installed.

    <li>
      Stay on top of the catering:
      replenish snacks,
      call for more coffee,
      etc.
    </li>
    <!-- FIXME: should this be a helper rather than the host? -->
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h3>At the End of the Last Day</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Ask learners to fill in the post-assessment form.

      or have
      them <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">contact us</a>.

</div>

<div class="well">
  <h3>After the Boot Camp</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Send the names and email addresses of those who actually
      attended&mdash;not just people who registered&mdash;to
      Software Carpentry admin.
      An easy way to do this is by sending us the sign-in sheets.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_report">Report back</a>
      to let us know how things camp went.
    </li>
    <li>
      Send one last email to attendees to remind them of any follow-up you have planned,
      direct them to <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2013/06/after-wise.html">other places</a> they can find help,
      and remind them to <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">contact us</a>

    <li>
      Arrange for the Software Carpentry administration fee to be paid,
