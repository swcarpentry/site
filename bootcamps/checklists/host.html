title: Bootcamp Checklist &mdash; Host
---

<p>
  A bootcamp host is a person (or group of people)
  who would like to arrange a bootcamp at their university,
  research lab,
  company,
  conference,
  or other venue.
  Hosts are responsible for finding funding for the bootcamp, 
  booking a room and catering,
  recruiting local helpers,
  and finding supplies like extension cords and sticky notes.
</p>

<div class="well">
  <h4>Getting Started</h4>
  <p>
    If you're considering hosting a bootcamp,
    think about:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Where it will be:
      Is a <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_venue">good
        venue</a> available?
      Will it cost anything to book?
    </li>
    <li>
      When it will be:
      Lots of factors will affect
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_when">when you can
        hold your bootcamp</a>;
      think about what makes sense for you and your audience.
      Be flexible,
      because instructor availability at our end will be a factor too.
    </li>
    <li>
      How you will fund it:
      The <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_cost">cost of
        running a bootcamp</a>
      includes instructors' travel and lodging,
      the Software Carpentry administration fee, 
      the cost of booking the room,
      and catering.
    </li>
    <li>
      Who the audience will be:
      Will the bootcamp be open to
      people in your lab,
      in your department,
      at your university or company,
      attending a conference,
      or anyone nearby?
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_numbers">How 
        many learners</a> can you accommodate?
    </li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    The answers to those questions will determine:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li><a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_who">Who will be
      permitted</a> to attend the bootcamp.</li>
    <li><a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_charge">What 
      it will cost</a> to attend the bootcamp (if anything).</li>
    <li><a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_followup">What
      kind of follow-up</a> will be offered.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>
    After you've thought about all that,
    <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">contact Software Carpentry admin</a>
    and let us know:
  </p>
  
  <ul>
    <li>
      your location and institution;
    </li>
    <li>
      your potential dates;
    </li>
    <li>
      the likely audience (research field, previous computing experience); and
    </li>
    <li>
      how many learners you're expecting.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">  
  <h4>Finalize Details</h4>
  <p>
    Together with the Software Carpentry administrator:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
    Find 
    <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_instructors">two 
      or three instructors</a> per room.
    </li>
    <li>If there is someone at your institution 
    who handles travel arrangements,
    connect instructors with them as soon as possible.
    If not, make sure instructors know how to submit receipts.
    </li>
    <li>
      Set a date.
    </li>
    <li>
      Set up registration (if you are handling it yourself)
      or give Software Carpentry admin the
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#eventbrite">information 
        needed</a>
      to set up an Eventbrite registration page.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>Local Coordination</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
    Book a room, keeping in mind 
    the <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_venue">ideal 
      room characteristics</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Recruit <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_helpers">helpers</a>.</li>
    <li>
      Discuss the bootcamp content and audience with instructors.
      (Software Carpentry admin will set up a mailing list for you,
      your instructors,
      and the helpers.)
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are restricting registration to a particular audience,
      monitor registration.
      (Software Carpentry admin will give you access to the Eventbrite event.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Book <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_catering">catering</a>
      (if you are supplying coffee and snacks)
      or find out where the nearest coffee shop is.
    </li>
    <li>
      Obtain or locate <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_equipment">all necessary gear</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Confirm that instructors have booked their travel
      and that they know how to submit receipts for reimbursement.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you are using something other than 
      first-come&ndash;first-served registration,
      select the attendees you want to attend and 
      let them know they have a seat.

  <h4>A Week Before</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Email bootcamp registrants and tell them:
      <ul>
        <li>
	  to visit the bootcamp web page for setup information,
          bootcamp location,
	  etc.
	  Emphasize the importance of setting up their computers well in advance.
	</li>
        <li>
	  to let us know if they can't come to the bootcamp.
          (They can't cancel their own registration on Eventbrite&mdash;they 
          have to email you or Software Carpentry admin.)
	</li>
        <li>
	  anything else they need to know about the location, parking, etc.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      If there are cancellations,
      offer those spaces to people on the waiting list.
      (Eventbrite doesn't do this automatically.)
      <!--FIXME need a link to section in OG about EB waiting lists.-->
    </li>
    <li>
      If possible,
      plan dinner or drinks with the helpers and instructors 
      the evening before the bootcamp.
      (Planning to go out for drinks or dinner after the first day 
      is not a terrible idea, either.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Find out where the bathrooms are,
      how to work the air conditioning,
      and who to call if something goes wrong with the facility or network.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure security will be expecting you and the doors will be unlocked.
    </li>
    <li>
      Print out sign-in sheets.
    </li>
    <!-- FIXME: We need printable sign-in sheets. -->

      Check that the network is working
      and that any required guest accounts have been set up.
    </li>
    <li>
      Check arrangements with catering (if appropriate).

      Put up signs directing learners to the room.
    </li>
    <li>
      Give instructors and helpers ID badges or stickers.
    </li>
    <li>
      Post network connection instructions
      and the Twitter hashtag you're using for the bootcamp
      (usually #swc<em>something</em>).
    </li>
    <li>
      Remind helpers to mingle and encourage conversation
      as well as answer questions and debug setup problems.
      <!-- FIXME: not really the host responsibility? should be lead instructor -->
    </li>
    <li>
      As learners arrive,
      ask them to connect to the network
      and check that they have software installed.
      <!-- FIXME: not really the host responsibility? -->
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">

    <li>
      Distribute colored sticky notes to learners.
      <!-- FIXME: not really the host responsibility? -->
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>During the Boot Camp</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Stay on top of the catering:
      replenish snacks,
      call for more coffee,
      etc.
    </li>
    <!-- FIXME: should this be a helper rather than the host? -->
  </ul>

  <h4>At the End of the Last Day</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Collect the attendance sheet and photo release forms.

    <li>
      Tell attendees that we are always looking for more helpers 
      and instructors,
      and that we run a short online training class 
      for people who are interested.

    <li>
      Send Software Carpentry the contact information of 
      anyone who is interested in joining our team,
      or have them <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">contact us</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Consider organizing a gathering for dinner or drinks for the 
      participants and instructors to mingle. This is a great
      opportunity for people to network and participants to give
      feedback to the instructors in a casual setting.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="well">
  <h4>After the Boot Camp</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Send the names and email addresses of those who actually
      attended&mdash;not just registered&mdash;to
      Software Carpentry admin.
      An easy way to do this is by sending us the sign-in sheets.
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{page.root}}/bootcamps/operations.html#host_report">Let us 
      know</a>

    <h4>Pitfalls for Hosts</h4>

    <p>
    Organizing a good bootcamp is not trivial, 
    and there are a few pitfalls to avoid.
    </p>

    <dt>Don't underestimate setup requirements</dt>  
    <dd>
      <p>
	Do you have enough power outlets?  (Are you sure?)
	Do you have enough bandwidth to handle fifty people hitting your version control repository at the same time?  (How do you know?)
	Can everyone actually log in?
	Does campus security know you're using the room over the weekend?
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dl>
    <dt>Don't let your learners ignore each other.</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
      Software Carpentry bootcamps are a great networking opportunity
      for our learners (and for us, too).
      Get to know your learners by name,
      have them work in pairs, and get them to mix up the pairs
      at least a couple of times.
        Encourage them to chat to one another at coffee breaks and lunch,
        and to get a pizza or some curry together for dinner on the first day.
      </p>
    </dd>

    <dt>Don't Underestimate The Potential for Mishaps</dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
      Something always fails to install for someone (or they fail to install
      anything at all), or a bunch of learners are accidentally locked out of
      the building after lunch, or whoever was supposed to drop off power bars
      didn't.  Roll with it, and remember to laugh (even if it's a bit
      hysterically).
