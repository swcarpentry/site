title: Boot Camp Checklist &mdash; Helpers
---

<p>
  Helpers provide assistance to boot camp learners during practical sessions.
  Helpers are often alumni of previous boot camps,
  and may be planning to become instructors. 
</p>

<p>
  As a helper,
  your job is to help the attendees during practical sessions
  and to help the host and instructors with everything from missing extension cords
  to data files that won't download
  Helping at a boot camp is also an opportunity to learn the material well enough
  to teach it yourself in future.

  <h3>Before</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You will be added to the boot camp mailing list.
      Introduce yourself,
      and feel free to ask questions and make suggestions. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Read the blog posts by <a href="{{page.root}}/blog/2012/10/how-to-help-at-a-boot-camp.html">Katy Huff</a>
      and <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/blog/2012-11-02-top-tips-helpers-software-carpentry-bootcamp">Aleksandra Pawlik</a>
      on how to be a helper.
    </li>
    <li>
      Let the lead instructor know what topics you'd like to help with.
      (The lead instructor will distribute a curriculum and schedule
      at least a week in advance of the boot camp.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Read over the material the instructors will cover
      in the sessions you're helping with.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Work through the setup instructions</strong> for the boot camp:
      the first thing you will see on the first day will be setup problems.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
  
<div class="well">
  <h3>During</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Help learners with setup problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      During exercises,
      walk around the room and look for learners who need help.
      They may have posted a red sticky note on their laptop,
      but they may also just be staring hopelessly at their screen,
      so pay attention to body language.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you can't answer an attendee's question,
      tell them that and ask an instructor for help.
      Do <em>not</em> dive into a 20-minute debugging session on their laptop.
    </li>
    <li>
      Between exercises, 
      answer questions and take notes (if required)
      on the boot camp's Etherpad.
    </li>
    <li>
      Help the instructors and host distribute sticky notes,
      feedback cards,
      sign-in sheets,
      and photo release forms.
    </li>
    <li>
      Make sure people fill in the post-assessment questionnaire
      before leaving at the end of the second day.
    </li>
  </ul>

<div class="well">
  <h3>After</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Consider writing a blog post about your experience.
    </li>
    <li>
      Let us know if you'd like to become an instructor yourself:
      we run a <a href="{{site.training_url}}/about/">free online training course</a>
      for people who'd like to.
