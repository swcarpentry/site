title: Bootcamp Checklist &mdash; Helpers
---

<p>
  Helpers provide assistance to bootcamp learners during practical sessions.
  They can be alumni of previous bootcamps or locals who have the right
  skills to help out. Helpers are typically not reimbursed for travel
  expenses or incidentals.
</p>
<p>
  As a helper,
  your job is to help the attendees during practical sessions
  and to help the host and instructors with everything from 
  missing extension cords
  to data files that won't download
  Helping at a bootcamp is also an opportunity to 
  learn the material well enough
  to teach it yourself in future.
</p>
<p>
  Helpers are the unsung heroes of Software Carpentry. 
  They need to have not only technical competence but also 
  the interpersonal skills to spot people who are confused
  and help them get unstuck.
  Helpers are vital to keeping bootcamps flowing smoothly.

  <h3>Before</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You will be added to the bootcamp mailing list.
      Introduce yourself,
      and feel free to ask questions and make suggestions. 
    </li>
    <li>
      Let the lead instructor know what topics you'd like to help with.
      (The lead instructor will distribute a curriculum and schedule
      at least a week in advance of the bootcamp.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Read over the material the instructors will cover
      in the sessions you're helping with.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Work through the setup instructions</strong> for the bootcamp:
      the first thing you will encounter on the first day will be setup
      problems.
    </li>
    <li>

  <h3>During</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Help learners with setup problems.
    </li>
    <li>
      During exercises,
      walk around the room and look for learners who need help.
      They may have posted a red sticky note on their laptop,
      but they may also just be staring hopelessly at their screen,
      so pay attention to body language.
    </li>
    <li>
      If you can't answer an attendee's question,
      tell them so and ask an instructor for help.
      Do <em>not</em> dive into a 20-minute debugging session.
    </li>
    <li>
      Between exercises, 
      answer questions and take notes (if required)
      on the bootcamp's Etherpad.
    </li>
    <li>
      Help the instructors and host distribute sticky notes,
      feedback cards,
      sign-in sheets,
      and photo release forms.
    </li>
  </ul>
