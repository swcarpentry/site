<p><strong>Note:</strong> Registration will be restricted to students associated with Data Scientist Training for Librarians.</p>
{% include bootcamps/instructors.html %}
<p>
<strong>What:</strong> Our goal is to help librarians and graduate students
become more productive by teaching them basic computing skills like program
design, version control, testing, and task automation. In this two-day boot
camp, short tutorials will alternate with hands-on practical exercises.
Participants will be encouraged both to help one another, and to apply what
they have learned to their own library-related problems during and between
sessions. 
</p>
<p>
<strong>Who:</strong> The course is aimed at librarians and graduate students
who are new to programming and need help familiarizing themselves with
different aspects of the research data lifecycle. The topics covered will help
attendees build better library data services and work more productively.
