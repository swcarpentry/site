title: How to Contribute

<p>
  Software Carpentry is an open project.
  Like all such projects,
  it needs your help to grow,
  and you can contribute in many ways,
  large and small.

    We run an online training course to help people become
    instructors.  The course requires 2-4 hours/week for 8-10 weeks,
    and covers the basics of educational psychology, instructional
    design, and how to apply both to teaching programming to
    scientists.  To find out more,
    visit <a href="{{site.training_url}}">the course website</a>.

    All of our slides, notes, and example programs are in our Git repositories at
    <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc">https://github.com/swcarpentry/bc</a>,
    and
    <a href="https://github.com/swcarpentry/site">https://github.com/swcarpentry/site</a>
    under <a href="license.html">open access licenses</a>;
    you are free to use them however you want
    so long as you <a href="{{page.root}}/license.html">give us attribution</a>.
    Everything is designed so that individuals can work through what they need on their own,
    but universities, research labs, companies, and self-study groups have also used it
    in week-long crash courses and as part of longer classroom courses.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you would like to deliver the course
    (as a Software Carpentry instructor or on your own) in one of these formats,
    or in one we haven't seen yet,
    please <a href="#discuss">let us know</a>&mdash;we'd be glad to offer training or advice.

  <h3>Partner</h3>

  <p>
    Software Carpentry is actively seeking ways to partner with other groups and initiatives
    to help change what scientists do and how they do it.

  <h4>EPSRC-Approved Software Training for Centres of Doctoral Training</h4>

  <p>
    The <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">Software Sustainability Institute</a>
    was <a href="http://gow.epsrc.ac.uk/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/H043160/1">founded by the EPSRC</a>
    as a national facility for cultivating world-class research through software.
    Based at the universities of Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford and Southampton,
    it is an EPSRC-approved supplier of training for the Centres for Doctoral Training (CDT) call.
    Its training packages are based on Software Carpentry,
    and its training packages include instructors who will travel to your organisation and present the course,
    a curriculum tailored to your requirements,
    and administration of the training event,
    from booking rooms to organising refreshments.
  </p>

  <p>
    The EPSRC has recognised the fundamental importance of software in research,
    and the necessity of good software development practices in producing accurate, reusable, and reproducible research.
    The <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">SSI</a>'s training courses
    make it easy to meet the EPSRC's software-development requirements
    without investing resources into creating new training,
    and without duplicating existing training materials and courses.
  </p>

  <p>
    For more information about how you can include the <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">SSI</a>'s training
    in your CDT bid,
    please see <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk/Training-For-CDTs">the full description</a>
    of what they offer,
    or contact the <a href="http://www.software.ac.uk">SSI</a>'s director,
    <a href="mailto:n.chuehong@software.ac.uk">Dr. Neil Chue Hong</a>.
