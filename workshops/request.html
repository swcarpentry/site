  Our instructors are volunteers, and so are not paid for their
  teaching, but host sites are required to cover their travel and
  accommodation costs. In addition, the Software Carpentry Foundation
  charges an administration fee for workshops that it helps organize
  at institutions which are not partners or affiliates.  For workshop
  requests received after September 1, 2015, these fees are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you have organized the workshop yourself
      (e.g., have found instructors and are managing inquiries),
      we are happy to help by setting up an Eventbrite registration page
      and creating pre- and post-workshop assessment questionnaires.
      In this case,
      we ask for (but do not require) a donation,
      and recommend $500 as a suitable amount.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you are a not-for-profit, such as a university or government
      lab: US$2500 if you are not a Software Carpentry Foundation
      partner, and $1250 if you are, but require our help.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      If you are a for-profit institution, such as a company:
      US$10,000, of which three quarters is used to underwrite
      workshops at institutions that could otherwise not afford
      them.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  We strive to be a global project and support diversity in science.
  If you wish to offer a workshop that would further these goals,
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">contact us</a> regarding a waiver for the administration fee.
</p>
<p>
  Note: if you hosted a workshop in 2015 before September 1,
  the old fee schedule applies for subsequent workshops hosted before the end of the year:
  please <a href="mailto:{{site.contact}}">contact us</a> for details.
