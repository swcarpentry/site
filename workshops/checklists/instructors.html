title: Workshop Checklist &mdash; Instructors
---
<p>
  Instructors lecture and lead practical exercises.
  You should also help learners during practical sessions,
  but remember to rest your voice as well.
  You <em>don't</em> need to know the curriculum
  for all the topics in your workshop,
  but it certainly helps
  (particularly if someone can't make it at the last minute).
</p>

<div class="well">
  <h4>Before</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If you haven't already done so,
      (or haven't done so recently),
      <strong>read the instructors' guide for the session that you will teach.</strong>
      You will find the guide with the lesson that you will teach.
    </li>
    <li>
      Arrange travel to the workshop site,
      accommodation,
      and transportation from your lodging
      to the workshop site.
    </li>
    <li>
      Find out (from the host) how to be reimbursed for travel expenses.
    </li>
    <li>
      Work with the
      <a href="{{page.root}}/workshops/checklists/lead_instructor.html">lead instructor</a> to figure out
      who's teaching what and when.
    </li>
    <li>
      Choose or prepare your lessons,
      data sets,
      cheat sheets,
      exercises,
      and version control repositories.
    </li>
    <li>
      Post your exercises, data sets, and cheat sheets
      on the workshop's web site.
      (The lead instructor
      will create a GitHub repository
      to host the workshop's web pages.)
    </li>
    <li>
      Work through your own setup instructions to make sure they're complete,
      and to ensure that you have the same setup as your learners.
    </li>
    <li>
      Do a dry-run of your entire lesson;
      this allows you to try out your examples and exercises
      to make sure they (still) work,
      and to make sure you'll have enough time to
      present all your material
      (or enough material to fill your time).
    </li>
    <li>
      Familiarize yourself with the material your fellow instructors will be presenting,
      in case one of them pulls out or loses their voice.
    </li>
    <li>
      Be aware of 
      <a href="{{site.github_url}}/workshop-template/wiki/Configuration-Problems-and-Solutions">common configuration problems</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      Get emergency contact information for the workshop host and other instructors in case of last-minute changes.
     </li>
